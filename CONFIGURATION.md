# Configuration

This reference covers the public configuration contract for AlpineClubBookingsNZ.
Start from `.env.example` and `config/club.example.json`, then replace values
for your club before running a shared or production deployment.

Do not commit `.env`, production credentials, payment/accounting tokens, or
database backups.

## Club Config

`src/config/club.ts` loads `config/club.json` first and falls back to
`config/club.example.json` when `club.json` is absent. For a new club, copy the
example and edit it:

```bash
cp config/club.example.json config/club.json
```

You can also run:

```bash
npm run setup:wizard
```

The wizard writes `config/club.json` only. It does not write `.env` files and
does not store API keys, OAuth secrets, SMTP secrets, or bearer tokens.

`config/club.json` is validated by `src/config/schema.ts`.

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | yes | Full public club name. |
| `shortName` | no | Short label used where space is limited. |
| `supportEmail` | yes | Main support address and default sender fallback. |
| `contactEmail` | no | Contact-form recipient; falls back to `supportEmail`. |
| `publicUrl` | yes | Canonical public origin with no trailing slash. |
| `emailFromName` | yes | Display name for outbound email sender headers. |
| `lodgeTravelNote` | no | Email reminder travel/location note. |
| `socialLinks.facebook` | no | Facebook URL used by public pages/footer. |
| `beds[].id` | yes | Stable bed or lodge identifier. |
| `beds[].name` | yes | User-facing bed/lodge name. |
| `beds[].capacity` | yes | Positive integer capacity. |
| `beds[].type` | yes | One of `dormitory`, `private`, or `shared`. |
| `ageTiers[].id` | yes | One of `INFANT`, `CHILD`, `YOUTH`, or `ADULT`. |
| `ageTiers[].label` | yes | User-facing age-tier label. |
| `ageTiers[].minAge` | yes | Minimum age, inclusive. |

## Branding Assets

Replace the default assets in `public/branding/`:

- `logo.png`
- `favicon.ico`
- `favicon.png`
- `og-image.png`
- `lodge.jpg`
- `ski-field.jpg`
- `snowboarder.jpg`
- `sunset.jpg`

The matching `*.example.*` files are placeholders for forks and public docs.

## Required Local Setup Variables

These are enough for a local database-backed app with external services left in
test/demo mode or disabled:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string used by Prisma. |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | PostgreSQL password used by Docker Compose. |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Auth.js session secret. |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Legacy Auth.js secret fallback; keep aligned with `AUTH_SECRET`. |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Exact app origin, for example `http://localhost:3000`. |
| `AUTH_TRUST_HOST` | Set `true` behind trusted proxies/Compose. |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Shared secret for cron and deploy status endpoints. |
| `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` | Email for the first seeded admin account. |
| `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Initial password for the first seeded admin account. |

`prisma/seed.ts` fails before seeding if either `SEED_ADMIN_*` value is unset.
The seeded admin is forced through `/change-password` on first login.

## Setup Readiness

Run this before bootstrapping a new install:

```bash
npm run setup:check
```

The check validates `config/club.json`, environment variable presence/format,
feature flag values, and first-install readiness. Database-backed checks are
reported inside the admin setup wizard after migrations and seed data run.

After signing in as an administrator, open `/admin/setup` to review:

- club config and feature flags
- first admin and seeded database settings
- booking policies, age tiers, seasons, and rates
- Stripe, SES/email, Sentry, operational Xero, and finance Xero readiness
- Xero account and item-code mappings

Provider tests on `/admin/setup` run only when an admin clicks the relevant test
button. They should use test/demo provider credentials until the environment is
ready for production.

## App Defaults

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `CURRENCY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CURRENCY` | Currency display and server default. |
| `TZ`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_TZ` | Time zone; this app expects New Zealand date-only booking semantics unless a feature says otherwise. |
| `LOCALE`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCALE` | Locale for formatting. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Pino log level such as `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, or `fatal`. |
| `APP_RUNTIME_ROLE` | Runtime label used by health/status reporting, usually set by Compose. |
| `NODE_ENV` | Runtime mode set by Node/Next. |
| `NEXT_RUNTIME` | Runtime marker set by Next.js instrumentation. |
| `npm_package_version` | Package version exposed by npm scripts. |

## Feature Flags

Only the literal string `true` enables these flags. Any other value disables
the deploy-time capability. Admins can then activate or deactivate each
capability at `/admin/modules`. A module is available only when both layers are
enabled:

```text
effective module state = env capability enabled && admin module enabled
```

Missing module-setting rows default to enabled so upgraded installs keep the
previous env-only behavior after migrations. If the settings table cannot be
read, optional modules fail closed and their protected routes return the same
404-style blocked responses as disabled env flags.

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `FEATURE_KIOSK` | Allows admins to enable lodge kiosk routes/navigation. |
| `FEATURE_CHORES` | Allows admins to enable chores and roster surfaces. |
| `FEATURE_FINANCE_DASHBOARD` | Allows admins to enable finance dashboard routes/navigation and finance sync cron registration. |
| `FEATURE_WAITLIST` | Allows admins to enable waitlist routes and waitlist cron registration. |
| `FEATURE_XERO_INTEGRATION` | Allows admins to enable operational Xero routes/navigation and Xero cron registration. |

## Admin Module Activation

The Admin dashboard includes `/admin/modules` for club-level activation of the
optional modules covered by the feature flags above. These settings are stored
in the `ClubModuleSettings` database table as booleans only. They do not store
secrets, tokens, tenant ids, or external provider credentials.

The `.env` feature flags remain deploy/operator capability gates. A module is
ready only when its feature flag is `true` and its Admin Modules activation is
enabled. New installations seed the activation row with all module activations
enabled so existing deployments keep their current behaviour until an admin
changes the database-backed settings.

databases for validation.
