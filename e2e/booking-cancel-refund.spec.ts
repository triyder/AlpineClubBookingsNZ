// Critical row (docs/END_TO_END_TEST_MATRIX.md): cancel a paid booking and
// receive the settlement with correct status transitions. A future-dated PAID
// booking owned by Nadia (prisma/demo-seed.ts, id PAID_CANCEL_BOOKING_ID) is
// cancelled with the CREDIT method — deterministic and Stripe-free: the seeded
// SUCCEEDED payment has no additional- or setup-intent fields, so the
// credit-path cancel writes the account credit with zero external calls
// (src/lib/booking-cancel.ts). This spec asserts the MONEY OUTCOME — the point
// of the row, and the guard for the P0-1/P0-2 cancel-refund fixes:
//   1. the member's booking flips to CANCELLED with a positive account credit
//      (inline component state, then the reloaded Cancellation Outcome card);
//   2. the admin payments ledger records the credit as an "Account credit"
//      settlement.
//
// Nadia (not Wanda/Alice) owns the booking: no other spec asserts Nadia's
// bookings or account credit — she only drives a nomination in
// membership-application.spec — so cancelling it and crediting her account
// cannot perturb another spec in the serial suite.
//
// Card-refund (real Stripe refund) coverage is intentionally NOT added here: it
// requires Stripe test-mode keys and the datacenter-IP flake mitigations of
// stripe-payment.spec, which would destabilise this otherwise-deterministic
// money-outcome check. Card refund stays Vitest/service-only (see the matrix).
