// Issue #2146 — a finance manager or admin browsing in DARK mode printed or
// exported a report and got a page that looked blank.
//
// Every other guard on this behaviour is a source-text parser: the contract test
// `src/lib/__tests__/print-light-palette-contract.test.ts` reads globals.css and
// the TSX and reasons about the cascade. None of them ever RENDERS the page
// under print + dark and looks at a computed colour, which is the medium the bug
// actually lived in — the fix turns on a specificity subtlety (`text-card-fore-
// ground` on `ui/card.tsx` matching the element directly and so beating the
// print root's inherited `!important`) that no amount of source parsing settles.
//
// This spec closes that gap, and it also closes the gap the CSS parser
// structurally CANNOT see: a Tailwind `dark:` utility written in a class string
// compiles into Tailwind's own generated output, never into globals.css, so no
// `@media not print` wrapper there can exclude it. Here it is simply rendered.
//
// What this spec does NOT cover: the `html2canvas` **Download PDF** path in
// `src/lib/report-pdf.ts`. `emulateMedia` switches the print medium; it does
// not run html2canvas, and nothing here clicks Download PDF. That path's only
// coverage is the jsdom unit test over `forceLightPaletteInClone` plus a
// source-string check that the `onclone` hook is wired — the function and the
// wiring, not the html2canvas contract or the produced PDF. Verify a real
// export by hand in both themes when changing it.
//
// E2E_ADMIN is a Full Admin, so both printable report surfaces are reachable
// from the session saved once in auth.setup.ts (#1779).

// next-themes storage key — `UI_THEME_STORAGE_KEY` in

// React component and pulling it into the Playwright node process would drag in
// next-themes and lucide for the sake of one string. If the key ever drifts, the
// `prefers-color-scheme` emulation below still resolves the app's
// `defaultTheme="system"` to dark, and the explicit `.dark` precondition in
// every case fails loudly rather than passing vacuously.

/**
 * Read the computed foreground and background of `selector` as WCAG relative
 * luminance (0 = black, 1 = white), evaluated in the page so the browser's own
 * media/colour-scheme emulation is what resolves the cascade.
 *
 * `background-color` walks up to the first non-transparent ancestor, because a
 * card's own background may be `transparent` with the paint coming from the
 * print root.
 *
 * The serialization is asserted to be `rgb()`/`rgba()` rather than parsed
 * leniently. `getComputedStyle` does NOT normalise every colour to sRGB: a
 * value specified in `oklch()` serializes back as `oklch(0.985 0 0)`, and this
 * stylesheet's raw `:root` / `.dark` ramps ARE oklch. Scraping `[\d.]+` out of
 * that string reads `0.985, 0, 0` as sRGB 0-255 channels and scores luminance
 * ≈ 0.00006 — so the literal near-white #2146 value would SATISFY the
 * `colorLuminance < 0.3` dark-ink assertion. Only the surfaces asserted today
 * happen to chain to hex `--brand-*`; one token change turns that silent false
 * pass on. Failing loudly with the raw string is the safe direction.
