/*
  #2263 (epic #2245) — the member whole-lodge request journey, and the privacy
  guarantee it is built around.

  Matrix rows (docs/END_TO_END_TEST_MATRIX.md):
    - Critical: member whole-lodge journey (submit → officer approves → hold).
    - Critical: uniform-response privacy (the byte-compare below).
    - High:     admin queue badges, availability strip, approve + hold.

  WHY THE BYTE-COMPARE LIVES HERE AND NOT IN VITEST. The unit layer runs with
  Prisma mocked, so "three worlds" there is a fiction: the same mock answers
  every question identically whatever the world is supposed to be, and the test
  passes without ever having had three worlds. The claim is only worth something
  against REAL ROWS, which means the seeded database and therefore Playwright.

  The three worlds, each VERIFIED FROM THE ADMIN SIDE before a single request is
  submitted — an unverified world would make the byte-compare vacuous, since
  three identical acknowledgements from three identically-empty worlds prove
  nothing:
    A. CLEAR       — a fresh stay window nothing else touches; free beds > 0.
    B. FULL        — WAITLIST_FULL_WINDOW, seeded past the lodge's capacity;
                     free beds 0.
    C. HELD        — a window this spec puts an exclusive whole-lodge hold on;
                     the hold route itself reports wholeLodgeHold back.

  MECHANICS THAT MATTER:
    - THREE DISTINCT MEMBER SESSIONS, one per world. The cap of two open
      requests per member and the shared per-member rate-limit window would
      otherwise make the result depend on submission order — the third
      submission from one member would 409 on the cap and the test would be
      asserting the wrong thing (or, worse, pass by comparing two identical
      error bodies).
    - All three personas HOLD A LOGIN. The obvious "third member" candidates do
      not: LODGE_FILL_OWNER is seeded `canLogin: false` (it exists only to own
      the capacity-filling booking), and Bob/Evan are seeded un-enrolled in
      two-factor so the 2FA specs can drive real enrollment — logging them in
      here would consume that state. Nadia (NOMINATOR_TWO) is seeded PAID with a
      complete, self-confirmed profile and already logs in for
      booking-cancel-refund.spec, which runs earlier in this serial suite. This
      spec only adds a booking REQUEST for her and asserts nothing about the
      bookings or account credit that spec owns.
    - RETRY-SAFE. CI retries this file up to twice and every retry re-submits.
      Each world submits from its OWN synthetic client IP (the same
      x-forwarded-for mechanism e2e/helpers/auth.ts uses for logins), so the
      shared per-IP window cannot decide the outcome; `beforeAll` clears any
      open member-origin request a previous attempt left behind, so the
      2-open-request cap cannot either; and world C reuses an existing booking
      and tolerates an already-set hold. Without all three, attempt 3 fails on a
      limiter or a duplicate rather than on the behaviour under test. The
      capacity-holding anchor's separate `POST /api/bookings` uses the shared
      booking-create census as well, so earlier spec retries cannot exhaust its
      setup bucket.
