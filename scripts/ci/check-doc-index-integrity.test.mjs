  HEADROOM FOR A WHOLE-REPOSITORY SCAN, not cover for a slow test.

  Thirteen cases here shell out to `git` or initialise a throwaway repository,
  and the heaviest call `loadTrackedFiles(REPO_ROOT)`, which lists and reads
  every tracked file — over 4,500 of them. That is the point: the real-repository
  CLI cases are the strongest thing in this suite, and they are what caught the
  `synchronize`-payload trap. They need the real tree, not a fixture.

  Under vitest's 5-second default that work does not reliably finish on a busy
  runner, and a *different* case loses each time. It failed exactly that way on
  PR #2922, whose diff is documentation and cannot reach the subject of the test
  that failed — 28.5s for the file against roughly 19s idle (#2923).

  The mechanism was seen before this suite merged and mis-read as Windows load
  sensitivity that "does not reproduce on CI's Linux runners". The first half was
  right; the second half was an assumption. Nothing here is Windows-specific —
  the runner only has to be busy.

  Same treatment, and the same reasoning, as the whole-tree parser scan in
  `src/lib/__tests__/jsx-text-escape-guard.test.ts`. If a case ever genuinely
  needs a minute, that is a real regression worth looking at; this only stops the
  clock deciding which assertion runs.

 * This file is the ONE entry in the checker's `CITATION_EXEMPT_FILES`, which
 * covers both the invariant-id scan and the line-number citation scan. Its
 * fixtures must contain unresolvable ids, unrecognised prefixes and line-number
 * citations, because that is what they assert the checker rejects. Every fixture
 * below is therefore a literal that would fail the real scan, which is the
 * point. Nothing else is exempt — not even the checker itself.
 *
 * It is NOT exempt from the encoding audit, so the mojibake fixtures are built
 * from code points rather than written out: this file stays ASCII and the check
 * it is testing stays green over it.
 *
 * Exempt from the scan is not exempt from the habit, though. Where a fixture
 * needs a well-formed id that resolves to NOTHING, it uses a real number under
 * the fixture's own prefix — `002`, which this repository defines — so a grep
 * for that prefix still lands on a real rule; the id is unresolved in the
 * fixture repository below, which defines only `001`, and that is what the
 * assertion is about. The fenced-width tests necessarily spell malformed
 * two- and four-digit forms under a live prefix: they are isolated in this sole
 * exempt fixture file and prove the production scanner rejects exactly those
 * forms. Where a fixture needs a well-formed number far out of range, it uses a
 * prefix this repository does not declare. No illustrative well-formed id
 * invents a number under a live prefix, which is the trap #2889 closed and the
 * rule `SCHEME.md` §1.4 states.
