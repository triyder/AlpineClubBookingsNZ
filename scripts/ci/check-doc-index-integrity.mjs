/**
 * Documentation index integrity: every doc is reachable, every cited invariant
 * id exists (issue #2691).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * #2691 split a 7,135-line `docs/DOMAIN_INVARIANTS.md` into per-domain files
 * under `docs/invariants/`, each rule carrying a permanent `INV-<PREFIX>-<NNN>`
 * id, and replaced the nine-document "Read First" list in `AGENTS.md` with a
 * small always-read core plus a routing table. Both halves of that only work
 * while these properties hold, and none of them is self-maintaining:
 *
 *  - **A prefix's numbers are dense.** They run from `001` to that prefix's
 *    highest with no holes, which is the whole reason "take the next number" is
 *    mechanical rather than a matter of looking carefully. See
 *    {@link auditNumberSequences}.
 *  - **Merged ids are append-only.** Density alone cannot see the highest id
 *    being deleted, or a whole prefix disappearing. The current definitions are
 *    therefore also compared with the base revision. See
 *    {@link auditPermanentInvariantIds}.
 *  - **Every cited id resolves.** An id is cited from places this repository
 *    cannot rewrite — merged commits, closed issues, lint strings shipped in a
 *    release, test names in a fork. A citation that resolves to nothing is the
 *    exact failure #2691 exists to prevent: a rule written down correctly that
 *    still does not hold, because the pointer to it went stale.
 *  - **Every doc is reachable from an index.** The issue's own watchpoint names
 *    the routing table as the part most likely to rot. A doc nothing links to is
 *    a doc nobody finds, which is how `docs/DOMAIN_INVARIANTS.md` became
 *    unreachable-at-the-moment-of-need in the first place.
 *  - **The routing table points at things that exist.** Every prefix it names is
 *    a declared prefix, every declared prefix has a row, and every document it
 *    links to is a real file.
 *  - **Nobody cites a line number into the invariants.** A `:NN` suffix is stale
 *    the next time somebody edits above it; the whole point of the id scheme is
 *    that it is not.
 *  - **No tracked text file is mojibake or carries a byte-order mark.** One
 *    invariant file was committed double-encoded and every other gate stayed
 *    green. See {@link auditEncoding}.
 *
 *   npm run docs:indexcheck                       # check, non-zero on any problem
 *   node scripts/ci/check-doc-index-integrity.mjs  # same
 *
 * ## The `INV-` namespace was already occupied
 *
 * This repository writes `INV-…` strings in quantity as **Xero invoice numbers**
 * in test fixtures, and four of them match the invariant citation shape exactly
 * (`INV-IB-001`, `INV-SETTLE-001`, `INV-SETTLE-002`, `INV-SUP-001`). They are
 * carried in {@link RESERVED_INVOICE_PREFIXES} below.
 *
 * An **unrecognised** prefix is a hard failure rather than something the
 * reserved list waves through. That is deliberate and it is the whole reason the
 * `INV-` namespace was safe to adopt: the likelier mistake is a typo'd prefix —
 * `INV-CPA-…` written for `INV-CAP-021` — and a blanket whitelist would make
 * exactly that mistake invisible. Every failure mode here is a noisy error; none
 * of them is a silent mis-resolution.
 *
 * ## Scanning rules
 *
 * Definitions, ordinary citations and malformed shapes skip Markdown literal
 * regions, so a document may show placeholders and fixture ids without treating
 * them as definitions. One bounded CommonMark block pass classifies fenced and
 * indented code, raw HTML, paragraphs, and ATX/Setext headings while retaining
 * blockquote/list containers. A second, narrower pass does inspect the literal
 * view: a
 * well-formed id under a prefix the repository really declares must resolve
 * there too. That catches an invented live-prefix example while leaving
 * `INV-<PREFIX>-<NNN>` placeholders, reserved invoice numbers and custom fixture
 * prefixes alone.
 * Inline backticks are **not** skipped — most real citations in prose are
 * written `` `INV-CAP-021` `` and skipping them would make the check blind to
 * the common case.
 *
 * Anchor-style citations (`…#inv-cap-021`) are deliberately not handled here.
 * `npm run docs:linkcheck` already validates fragments against real headings, and
 * duplicating it would give two places to disagree.

/**
 * No tracked text file contains a raw control character.
 *
 * ## Why this is worth a gate of its own
 *
 * An editing tool — a shell or Python heredoc, a `sed` script, anything that
 * interprets escapes on the way in — turns the two characters `\b` into the one
 * byte they name, 0x08. The damage is **completely invisible in every normal
 * view**: an editor, `git diff`, a GitHub blob and `JSON.stringify` all render
 * 0x08 back as `\b`, so the source reads as correct and a reviewer cannot see
 * it. Only `cat -A`, or a grep over the raw bytes, shows what is really there.
 *
 * In a regex it is fatal. `/\bINTERVAL\b/i` becomes a pattern demanding a
 * literal backspace either side of the word, and no source file contains one —
 * so it matches nothing. When the assertion built on it is NEGATIVE, as
 * `.not.toMatch()` is, the guard then passes unconditionally: it is not merely
 * weakened, it can never fail again.
 *
 * ## What was actually measured (#3072)
 *
 * Censused over all 5,074 tracked files on the epic branch: **8 of the 4,959
 * Git-classified text files carried a control byte**, 14 bytes in all. They
 * split cleanly in two, and the split is the reason this check phrases its
 * failure the way it does.
 *
 * **Five files, 9 bytes, were the accident** — an escape eaten on the way in:
 *
 * - two were NEGATIVE assertions that could never fail again. One banned
 *   `INTERVAL` from every SQL statement in the booking/membership diagnostics
 *   pack, so timestamp arithmetic on a lodge night was unguarded; the other
 *   asserted that no member email address can reach the Xero containment
 *   screen, so a privacy claim was passing unconditionally.
 * - two more were the FIRST TWO of the eleven forbidden patterns in one
 *   provenance guard's list. The other nine still matched, so the suite stayed
 *   green and nothing named the two dead ones. (Counted, not recalled: the
 *   inherited docblock said "patterns 11 and 12 of a list of twelve … the other
 *   ten", and all three numbers were wrong.)
 * - one was a normalisation step (`.replace(/\btype\b/g, " ")`) that stripped
 *   nothing. It is equivalent on today's inputs because no scanned import
 *   carries the token, which is exactly why it survived: a latent trap, armed
 *   for whoever next writes `import { type Editor }`.
 * - one was comment prose, where `D:\var\backups` had become unreadable.
 *
 * **Three files, 5 bytes, were deliberate data** and behaviourally correct: a
 * PKZIP magic number in a fixture, a form feed fed to the HTML sanitiser, and a
 * NUL separating the halves of a composite map key in application source. Each
 * now spells the same value as an escape, which is why this check needs no
 * exemption for them. A tenth site, the same NUL-separator shape in
 * `src/lib/config-transfer/import-types.ts`, had already been normalised — see
 * `.gitattributes`, which still carries the `diff` attribute that made it
 * reviewable.
 *
 * Nothing else in the toolchain sees any of this: lint, typecheck, knip and the
 * full test suite all stayed green, exactly as they did for the BOM and the
 * double-encoding above.
 *
 * ## No allowlist, deliberately
 *
 * A control byte in a tracked text file has no legitimate use here, **including
 * inside a comment** — a comment is where you look to understand the code under
 * it. Where a control character is genuinely wanted as DATA, the escape
 * sequence denotes exactly the same value (`"\0"` is byte 0x00, `"PK\x03\x04"`
 * is the PKZIP magic), so writing it as an escape costs nothing, changes no
 * behaviour, and keeps the file readable. That is what the three deliberate
 * sites above now do.
 *
 * TAB, LF and CR are excluded because they are the text format itself.
 *
 * **The one case this stance has no answer for, stated because it is the real
 * limit rather than the comfortable one.** "The escape denotes the identical
 * value" holds only in a format that HAS escapes. A plain-text pin file has
 * none: `*.txt`, `*.tsv` and `docs/BLUE_GREEN_MIGRATION_SAFETY.tsv` are
 * class-pinned `text`, and a pin file that genuinely had to hold an ESC or DEL
 * byte could not be written at all under this rule. The same is true of a
 * vitest inline snapshot, which vitest rewrites from the runtime value rather
 * than from what you typed (`help-corpus.test.ts` carries one). Neither case
 * exists in the tree today, and neither has a fix that is better than an
 * allowlist — so if one ever arrives, it is a decision about this rule, not a
 * bug in this function.
 *
 * ## The one hole, and why {@link auditTextScanCoverage} exists
 *
 * This scan sees the file set `loadTrackedFiles` hands it, which is Git's own
 * text classification. Measured against git 2.53: Git calls a file binary when
 * it finds a **NUL in the first 8,000 bytes** — and only then. So 0x08, 0x0B,
 * 0x0C and 0x7F are seen at any offset, and the whole accident class above is
 * fully covered; a NUL is covered only past byte 8,000. The real NUL site sat
 * at byte 12,529 and was seen, but that was luck, not coverage.
 *
 * A blind spot is worse than an allowlist, because an allowlist is at least
 * written down. {@link auditTextScanCoverage} closes it without widening this
 * scan into binary assets, and {@link findFilesHiddenFromTextScan} explains why
 * it asks the question the way round that it does: a file that drops out of the
 * text scan fails UNLESS `.gitattributes` declares it a binary asset, so a file
 * class nobody has thought about fails closed rather than leaving the scan in
 * silence.

/**
 * No file has an early NUL hiding it from the text scan, unless it is a
 * declared binary asset.
 *
 * {@link auditControlCharacters} can only judge files it is given, and
 * {@link loadTrackedFiles} gets them from `git grep -I`. Measured against git
 * 2.53, that excludes a file with a NUL in its first 8,000 bytes — so a single
 * early NUL would hide a source file, and every other check in this script with
 * it.
 *
 * ## The question is asked the SAFE way round, and that took two attempts
 *
 * The first version of this check asked whether `.gitattributes` DECLARED the
 * hidden file `text`, on the stated grounds that "every tracked text class here
 * is pinned". **Measured at the time of writing, that was false for 43 of the
 * 4,960 Git-classified text files, across 18 classes** — the 24 `.html`
 * mockups, `knip.jsonc`, `Dockerfile`, `Caddyfile`, `deploy/caddy/*.caddy`,
 * `scripts/lib/split-sql-statements.awk`, `.env.example`, two `.tsv` files,
 * `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`, `.nvmrc`, `.node-version`, `LICENSE` and the
 * rest. Those pins exist to stop Windows materialising CRLF, and nobody ever
 * promised they were exhaustive.
 *
 * So the check they backed was vacuous for exactly the files most exposed to
 * the accident: a `.awk` script, a `Dockerfile` and a `Caddyfile` are what a
 * shell heredoc or a `sed` one-liner edits. Proven end to end on `knip.jsonc`,
 * which gates a required check: a NUL at byte 200 made `git grep -I` drop it,
 * the declaration test filtered it out, and the run exited **0** printing
 * "Scanned 4959 tracked file(s)" — one fewer than the truth — while the success
 * line asserted the very property that had just been broken.
 *
 * A rule that fails open on a class nobody thought of is not a rule. So the
 * predicate is inverted: a hidden file fails UNLESS `.gitattributes` declares
 * it `-text` (which the standard `binary` macro sets). Adding a new text class
 * now needs no action at all, and adding a new BINARY class fails loudly until
 * somebody declares what it is — the direction an omission should point.
 *
 * ## Two things this is careful not to be
 *
 * **Not an allowlist for control bytes.** `*.png binary` says what a PNG IS; it
 * does not exempt a text file from {@link auditControlCharacters}. A declared
 * binary asset was never in the text scan to begin with.
 *
 * **Not a heuristic.** {@link findFilesHiddenFromTextScan} reads the file and
 * confirms the NUL is really there before reporting it, so the message is true
 * by construction rather than inferred from an absence.

/**
 * Every prefix's numbers run from `001` to its highest with no
 * gaps (issue #2889).
 *
 * ## Why contiguity is the property, and why it is enough
 *
 * `SCHEME.md` §1.3 allocates a new invariant `max + 1`. Nothing used to check
 * the arithmetic, and a wrong number is irreversible: §1.4 makes an id permanent
 * the moment it merges, so a skipped block of numbers is a hole this repository
 * keeps forever.
 *
 * Density is what makes `max + 1` *forced* rather than merely instructed. Every
 * number below the maximum is taken, and no id may be defined twice (the
 * duplicate-definition audit), so the only number a new invariant can have is
 * one more than the highest.
 * Any other choice is either a duplicate — caught there — or a hole, caught
 * here. Between the two, the allocation rule is mechanical.
 *
 * It also catches an interior deletion. Deleting the highest id or every id in
 * a prefix leaves no hole; {@link auditPermanentInvariantIds} closes those two
 * revision-shaped gaps instead.
 *
 * ## Why there is no allowlist
 *
 * `main` needed none when this was turned on, so nothing had to be closed or
 * excused first. The live totals are printed by the check rather than repeated
 * here, where concurrent invariant additions would make them stale.
 *
 * Nor is there a legitimate gap to allow. An id is never deleted — a superseded
 * rule keeps its heading and gains a status line, a retired one keeps its
 * heading and gains a reason — so a hole has exactly two causes, a wrong number
 * and a forbidden deletion, and both are things to fix rather than to register.
 * A register would only ever be the mechanism by which a wrong number becomes
 * permanent, which is the failure this assertion exists to prevent.
 *
 * If a prefix ever genuinely wants a reserved range, the answer is a new prefix.
 * Reserving numbers inside an existing one gives away the density that makes
 * `max + 1` forced, and buys nothing an id's location-independence (§1.4) does
 * not already give for free.
