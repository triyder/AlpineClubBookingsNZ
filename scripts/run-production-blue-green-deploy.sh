# of the build args the CI path passes. The image then carries no release
# identifier, so the pre-cutover warm-up gate cannot confirm it warmed the
# release being deployed and can only warn (`resolve_expected_release`), and the
# public website's per-release CSP nonce falls back to a per-BUILD seed.
#
# This mode is the supported way to do it: the same build args, from the same
# clean `git archive` workspace the deploy uses, on a commit that has already
# passed the published-commit check above - and the identifier is read back OUT
# of the built image BEFORE anything is pushed, because a build arg that never
# reached the runtime stage is exactly the failure this mode exists to close and
# it is invisible from the outside.

#
# THE DECLARATION KIND AND NOT THE EFFECTIVE ROLE, and the difference is the
# reason this is safe to assert at all: a correctly declared production
# installation whose administrator has switched the safer override on legitimately
# RESOLVES non-production, so asserting the resolved role would refuse a
# legitimate release. The declaration is the half a deployment owns.
#
# It is asserted from the CONTAINER's own self-report rather than from .env,
# because those are different questions. The step-3 preflight validates the FILE;
# the containers receive whatever Compose RESOLVED, and Compose prefers a value
# exported in the invoking shell over the env file and takes the LAST duplicate
# line rather than the first. The preflight refuses those shapes it can see, but a
# gate that is only right while it models Compose's precedence and dotenv grammar
# correctly is one Compose release away from being wrong — so the value is re-read
# from the process that actually got it, at step 14, with the old colour still
# serving and nothing switched.

# that sentence true on the host: it refuses to deploy at all if the bound that
# migrations will actually run under has gone missing, or if the value in force
# would remove the guard instead of relaxing it.
#
# WHY IT ASKS COMPOSE INSTEAD OF READING FILES. The first version read the
# shipped default out of docker-compose.yml with a `sed` and resolved overrides
# with `get_env_file_value`. Every way that can be wrong turned out to be
# reachable, and each one leaves the deploy PRINTING a bound the container never
# receives -- which is worse than no guard, by the same argument the ledger rows
# make about a named-but-absent mitigation:
#
#   - The `sed` was anchored to none of `DATABASE_URL:`, the migrate block, or a
#     line not commented out, and took the first match. A commented-out example
#     above the live setting was therefore preferred to it -- and the 45-line
#     comment this rewrite replaced made that a likely edit, not a contrived one.
#   - Compose does not read only docker-compose.yml. `COMPOSE_FILE` in the
#     project `.env` on the deployment host names an overlay as well, and a
#     `docker-compose.override.yml` is merged with no configuration at all.
#     Either can take the option off the migrate service without the tracked

#   - `get_env_file_value` misses an indented line, an `export ` prefix and
#     spaces around the `=`, and takes the FIRST duplicate where Compose takes
#     the LAST. This repository measured all four against real Compose in #3034
#     and fixed them for one key only; routing a safety-critical value through
#     the reader that was left broken put `MIGRATION_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS=0` -- the
#     single value this exists to refuse -- back within reach.
#
# `docker compose config` resolves the overlay list, the project `.env`, the
# shell environment and `${VAR:-default}` interpolation exactly as the step-13
# `docker compose run` will. Asking it is the only way the contract "the value
# checked here is the value the migrate container receives" is true rather than
# aspirational, and all three failures above stop existing rather than being
# patched one at a time.
#
# It still runs at step 3, before anything is pulled. The render needs `docker
# compose` (step 2) and a `.env` carrying DB_PASSWORD, which the
# `validate_env_contract` call immediately above it has just required; the
# `--profile` is what makes the migrate service present at all, exactly as at
# step 13. Everything else it needs, it renders for itself.
#
# Two failures it exists to catch, and both are silent without it:
#   - no lock_timeout on the connection migrations run on. Every migration then
#     waits forever again and no deploy output says so.
#   - MIGRATION_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS=0. PostgreSQL reads 0 as "wait forever", not as
#     "unset", so the most natural way to write "turn this off" is also the most
#     dangerous, and it looks like a configured value in every log.

# The deployment's declaration of what this installation IS (ENV-SAFETY 1, #3034;
# epic #2986; INV-CONFIG-003).
#
# THIS SCRIPT DEPLOYS THE CLUB'S LIVE SITE AND NOTHING ELSE, so it requires
# exactly `production`. That is narrower than the application parser, which
# accepts `production` OR `non-production`, and the difference is the whole point.
# There is no staging mode here, no `--env` switch and no alternate path: a
# non-production stack goes through `docker-compose.staging.yml` and
# `scripts/e2e-stack.sh`, which declare `non-production` themselves. A script
# whose only job is the live site accepting a declaration that says "this is a
# copy" would be accepting the one value it can prove is wrong.
#
# THAT IS NOT A THEORETICAL HOLE, it is the likeliest operator error. `.env.example`
# ships `APP_ENVIRONMENT_ROLE=non-production` — correct there, because it is a
# local-development template and a template that shipped `production` would have a
# developer's laptop declaring itself live. But `.env.example` is ALSO the file an
# operator diffs against their real `.env` when upgrading, and "a new key appeared
# in the template, copy it across" is the normal upgrade move. Following that
# through: the deploy passes, the migration runs, the new colour boots and resolves
# NON_PRODUCTION, and then every confirmation, payment notice, waitlist offer and
# renewal reminder for the club's REAL members is safety-suppressed — and every
# application-managed contact on the club's REAL Xero organisation has its email
# address rewritten to a non-deliverable one (INV-CONFIG-005). Destructive edits to
# live accounting, made confidently, by the very mechanism this epic added to keep
# members safe.
#
# So the safe-looking value is the unsafe outcome HERE, and only here. The correct
# pairing is `non-production` in the template (safe by default on a laptop) and
# `production` required at the one place that knows it is deploying production.
#
# WHY IT IS A HARD REFUSAL AND WHY IT RUNS IN THE PREFLIGHT. From this release on,
# an installation that has not declared itself resolves UNKNOWN, and UNKNOWN fails
# closed: nothing whose safety depends on knowing whether these are the club's real
# members goes out. An existing production install upgrading into this release has
# no declaration, so without this check the upgrade would succeed and then quietly
# stop sending mail — the outcome epic #2986 explicitly forbids shipping. Refusing
# at step 3 of 20 means the old colour is still serving, the migration has not run
# (step 13) and nothing has been switched (step 17): the operator fixes one line in
# .env and re-runs. `deploy-environment-role-contract.test.ts` pins that ORDER, not
# merely this function's existence, because moving the check after step 13 or step
# 14 brings the forbidden outcome straight back.
#
# The comparison is case-folded after trimming, exactly as
# `src/lib/environment-role-declaration.ts` folds it, so the deploy gate and the
# application cannot disagree about what counts as declared. A near miss is
# refused rather than guessed at: `prod`, `staging`, `true` and APP_RUNTIME_ROLE's
# own values are all rejected, because guessing is how a typo becomes "production".

# Protecting the previous release's rollback images from this deploy's own prune
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Rollback here means routing Caddy back to the previous colour (DEPLOYMENT.md
# -> "Rollback"). That needs the previous release's IMAGES still on the host,
# and this script's own `prune` was evicting them: step 18 removes the inactive
# colour's container, which leaves the old image referenced by nothing, and step
# 20 then prunes it. The deploy reported success and the rollback it documents
# had become impossible.
#
# A stopped placeholder container is the hold. `prune` never removes an image a
# container references, running or not.
#
# PIN THE IMAGE ID, NOT THE TAG. In local-build mode the running colour's image
# is the mutable `<project>-app:local`, and this deploy's own build re-tags that
# name onto the NEW image. A hold written against the tag therefore protects the
# image being deployed, lets the real rollback image fall dangling into the
# prune, and reports it retained - worse than no hold, because it is a hold that
# lies. `docker inspect --format '{{.Image}}'` on the RUNNING CONTAINER answers
# with the immutable id, which is the whole point of reading it there.

  # THE APPLICATION'S OWN ANSWER, asked of the container from inside it.
  #
  # THIS DELIBERATELY RE-IMPLEMENTS NOTHING. It used to parse
  # APP_ENVIRONMENT_ROLE in shell, mirroring readEnvironmentRoleDeclaration() --
  # and a second review lens showed why that was the wrong shape rather than
  # merely under-tested: it built six mutants of that snippet and FIVE survived
  # the source-text assertions guarding it, four of them making a container that
  # declares `non-production` report `production` so the deploy proceeded. A
  # duplicated parser pinned by greps is a parser that drifts, and pre-cutover it
  # was the SOLE witness -- the application`s own parse was only asserted after
  # the cutover, by verify_external_health.
  #
  # So the pre-cutover witness is now the same endpoint the post-cutover check
  # uses, /api/deploy/runtime-status, whose environmentRole comes from
  # readEnvironmentRoleDeclaration() itself. There is no second implementation
  # left to disagree, and this class of finding cannot recur. The contract test
  # asserts that no shell-side kind mapping comes back.
  #
  # THE SECRET NEVER LEAVES THE CONTAINER. CRON_SECRET is already in the app
  # environment (docker-compose.yml), so the request is authorised from inside
  # rather than by interpolating the secret into a `docker compose exec` argument
  # list, where it would be readable in the host`s process table. That is the same
  # care `verify_external_health` takes by feeding curl its header on stdin.
  # busybox wget (v1.37 in node:24.17-alpine) supports --header; the readiness
  # fetch above already relies on the same wget being present.
  #
  # REACHABLE AT THIS POINT, verified from the step order: step 14 runs
  # `up -d --force-recreate` then wait_for_health, and the container`s own
  # healthcheck polls /api/health/ready on this exact loopback address, so the
  # server is answering before this runs. The route is force-dynamic and touches
  # no database.
  #

# Pre-cutover warm-up gate (#2566, owner decision Option 4)
#
# The gate itself lives in the application (`src/app/api/deploy/warmup/route.ts`)
# and runs INSIDE the container it is warming, for three reasons set out in that
# file's header: the process that stores each page is then the process that
# answered, so warming the wrong colour is structurally impossible; untrusted CMS
# paths never touch a shell; and the tiered rules are unit-testable TypeScript
# rather than bash.
#
# This function's whole job is therefore to ask, print what came back, and refuse
# to cut over on anything that is not an acceptable verdict — including an
# unreadable answer.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Defined here rather than reused from the wrapper on purpose: the wrapper's
# `env_flag_is_true` lives INSIDE `run_production_wrapper`, and the internal engine
# runs as a separate invocation of this script, so that definition does not exist in
# this shell. Calling it would fail at the gate with "command not found" — i.e. it
# would block every deploy — which is the fail-closed direction but for the wrong
# reason.

# writes no body at all. The endpoint now also answers the text form with a readable
# `blocked` report, so the reason survives either way — but catching it HERE means the
# operator is told which setting is wrong before a container is even asked, and the
