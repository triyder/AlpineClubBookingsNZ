/**
 * Where a file's PREVIOUS length comes from (#2979).
 *
 * The ratchet's rule is unchanged: current size debt may stay, but new debt and
 * debt growth may not appear silently. What changes is where "previous" is read
 * from. It used to be a checked-in ledger, `scripts/quality/file-size-baseline.txt`,
 * and that file was the whole problem rather than the rule:
 *
 *   - every pull request that grows a listed file rewrites the same line, so the
 *     next pull request to merge re-conflicts it, forever. Measured on the 21 Aug
 *     wave: FIVE of nine lanes touched it, and `.gitattributes` gives it no merge
 *     driver (`CHANGELOG.md` is the only `merge=` entry), so every collision was
 *     a real three-way conflict;
 *   - resolving one by picking a side ships a WRONG number, and twice did. Two
 *     lanes both raised the `src/proxy.ts` line; their code merged cleanly in
 *     different regions and the merged file was 1329 lines while the recorded
 *     ceiling read either 1320 or 1208. A third recorded a ceiling of 1101 for a
 *     file whose untouched length on `main` was already 1104 — a ledger the tree
 *     violated the moment it landed;
 *   - and a stored number keyed by PATH is fooled by a rename. A `.ts` file
 *     renamed to `.js` left its entry behind and passed.
 *
 * Reading the previous length from the base ref instead removes the artifact and
 * every one of those failure modes with it. There is no line for two branches to
 * both rewrite, no stored number to drift from the tree, and a rename is followed
 * rather than guessed at, because git reports it.
 *
 * "The base ref" here means the MERGE BASE of that ref and `HEAD`, not its tip.
 * See `resolveBaseRef` for what that buys, and for what it costs.
 *
 * A rename is followed ONLY WITHIN THE BUDGETED SCOPE. Moving a file into
 * `src/` from `prisma/` or `scripts/` is not a rename this policy can inherit a
 * ceiling from, because those trees have no ceiling to inherit; such a file is
 * judged as new. See `resolveBaseSizes`.
 *
 * NO NETWORK, NO BUILD, NO DATABASE. Two `git` reads per changed file at worst.
 * CI's `verify` job already checks out full history (`fetch-depth: 0`), which is
 * what puts the real branch point in the clone at all — see `resolveBaseRef` for
 * what a truncated history does here, which is quieter and worse than failing.
 *
 * FAILS LOUDLY WHEN THE BASE CANNOT BE RESOLVED, and that is deliberate rather
 * than defensive: a gate that cannot read what it is comparing against must not
 * report a pass it has not earned. `npm run pr:check` already behaves this way
 * for the same reason — an unfetched `origin/main` is a failure there, not a
 * green. The remedy printed names the ref actually asked for.

 * branch diverged. That distinction is the difference between "what did this
 * change do" and "how does this checkout differ from wherever `main` has got
 * to", and only the first is a fair thing to fail somebody for.
 *
 * WHERE THE DIFFERENCE IS REAL, AND WHERE IT IS NOT. On a `pull_request` event
 * the two readings are IDENTICAL, and that was measured rather than assumed:
 * CI checks out `refs/pull/N/merge`, a merge commit whose first parent is the
 * base tip, so `merge-base(origin/main, HEAD)` IS `origin/main`. The merge tree
 * already carries `main`'s version of every file the branch did not touch, so
 * those files are not in the diff under either reading. The benefit AND the
 * cost below therefore both belong to LOCAL runs on a branch that has not
 * merged `main` in.
 *
 * WHAT IT BUYS, locally: a stale branch is not failed for growth it did not
 * cause. Measured while building #2979 — `origin/main` had moved ahead by one
 * merged pull request and `git diff origin/main` reported SEVEN `src/` files as
 * changed that the branch had never touched. They happened to be shrinks, so
 * nothing failed; had that pull request SPLIT a file instead, the local check
 * would have gone red for somebody else's edit, and the remedy would have been
 * to merge `main` — the treadmill this change exists to end.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS, locally, stated plainly because an earlier version of this
 * comment claimed the opposite. The merge base is NOT uniformly the stricter
 * reading. Measured counterexample: `src/lib/big.ts` is 1200 lines at the
 * branch point, `main` then splits it to 300, and the branch re-inflates it to
 * 1199. The merge-base ceiling is 1200, so the local run PASSES; the tip
 * ceiling would be `max(700, 300) = 700` and would fail. The gap closes the
 * moment `main` is merged in — the merge base then moves to the shrink — and it
 * never opens in CI at all, for the reason above.
 *
 * A MISSING merge base fails. A TRUNCATED history is the quieter hazard, and it
 * does not fail: in a `git clone --depth 1`, `origin/main` resolves, the merge
 * base comes back as HEAD itself, the diff is empty, and this check reports OK
 * over a tree holding a 1300-line module. That is measured, and it is why the
 * `verify` job's `fetch-depth: 0` is load-bearing — not because a shallow clone
 * has no merge base, but because a shallow one silently narrows the diff.

 *
 * That qualification is load-bearing, and its absence was a regression against
 * the ledger this replaced. The ledger scanned the whole tree, so a 1324-line
 * `prisma/demo-seed.ts` moved to `src/lib/demo-seed.ts` turned up as an
 * over-budget file with no entry and failed as new debt. Following the rename
 * unconditionally instead reads that move as "this file already had a 1324-line

 * nothing ever went red.
 *
 * So: a rename whose predecessor is not a production file is treated as a NEW
 * file, which must meet its documented budget outright. `movedFrom` records
 * where it came from, so the failure says that rather than calling a file the
 * reader can see in the history "new".
 *

 *
 * 1. **Ceiling drift cannot accumulate SEQUENTIALLY.** The ledger enforced exact

 *    behind, and no stale number can survive in between. What this does NOT
 *    cover is a branch that PREDATES the shrink: its merge base still holds the
 *    larger file, so it may re-inflate up to that older length and pass. See
 *    `resolveBaseRef` for the measured counterexample and why the exposure is
 *    confined to local runs.
 * 2. **A rename cannot launder debt**, because the previous length is looked up
 *    under the old path that git reports, not under a key that no longer exists
 *    — and, since the fix in `resolveBaseSizes`, only when that old path was
 *    itself inside the budgeted scope. A file arriving from `prisma/` or
 *    `scripts/`, or returning from a test path, is judged as new.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY STOPS DOING: it no longer judges files the change did not
 * touch. An untouched file cannot have grown, so there is nothing to catch — and
 * scanning them was the only reason the whole tree's debt had to be written down.
