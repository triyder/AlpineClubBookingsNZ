/**
 * The deliberate, visible escape from the file-size ratchet (owner decision,
 * 21 Aug 2026).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. #2979 deleted `scripts/quality/file-size-baseline.txt` and,
 * with it, `npm run quality:budget:update` — the one way to say "yes, this file
 * grows, I mean it". The issue called the result "today's semantics"; it was
 * not. Today there IS an escape, and removing it would leave **283 over-budget
 * files** — most of the modules people work in daily — unable to gain a single
 * line, ever. That is not hypothetical: measured against `origin/main` on the
 * day of the decision, PR #2980 grew eight already-over-budget files by 463
 * lines between them, and PR #2985 hit the same wall on `src/proxy.ts` and
 * escaped only by moving code out of it.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT A LEDGER AGAIN. A single shared file is precisely what #2979
 * exists to delete: every change edits the same lines, so every merge
 * re-conflicts, and resolving by hand shipped a wrong ceiling twice. So this
 * follows the pattern this repository already used to solve the identical
 * problem for `CHANGELOG.md` (#2452): **one new file per pull request**, under
 * `size-allowances.d/`, at a path no other pull request touches. Two branches
 * cannot conflict over files they do not share.
 *
 * WHY IT CANNOT ROT. An allowance is inherently ONE-SHOT. Once the pull request
 * merges, the grown length IS the base ref, so the same file needs no allowance
 * next time. Two rules keep that true:
 *
 *   - the recorded length must EQUAL the file's real length, so an allowance
 *     cannot drift away from the tree the way the ledger did, and cannot be
 *     re-used later for a different growth;
 *   - an allowance only has effect on the change that INTRODUCES it — the
 *     allowance file itself must be in this change's diff. After merge it is
 *     inert, and can be swept up in bulk exactly like a compiled changelog
 *     fragment.
 *
 * WHAT IT MAY NOT DO — the two things it must never reopen (#2987):
 *
 *   - it may not let a NEW file skip its budget;
 *   - it may not let a file RENAMED INTO the budgeted scope inherit a ceiling
 *     from outside it.
 *
 * Both are refused by name, with the reason, rather than silently ignored. It
 * also does not cover a file crossing its budget for the FIRST time: the owner
 * decision permits "growth of an existing in-scope over-budget file", and a
 * module that is still under its budget should be split before it goes over.
