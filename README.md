# AlpineClubBookingsNZ

AlpineClubBookingsNZ is an open-source booking, membership, payment, lodge, and finance
platform for small clubs. It is published as a real-world reference
implementation for a production Next.js application with payments, accounting,
email, scheduled jobs, and Docker-based deployment.

AlpineClubBookingsNZ is the open-source booking system originally built for and deployed
at [Tokoroa Alpine Club](https://tokoroa.org.nz).

The code is MIT licensed. Project branding, logos, copy, domains, and
operational content are included for context only; replace them before using a
fork for another organisation. See `NOTICE.md`.

Start with [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for the documentation hub and
recommended reading paths.

## What It Does

- Member registration, profile management, family/dependent relationships,
  declared partner relationships (request→confirm consent with admin
  assignment), and membership nomination workflows with reminder and admin
  recovery paths
- Bed-capacity booking flow with date-only New Zealand lodge nights, per-guest
  stay ranges, admin-placed partner second-occupants sharing a double bed (a
  reserved capacity slot per double, admin-only), waitlist, non-member holds,
  booking changes, cancellation rules, refunds, credits, promo codes, Stripe
  payments, and Xero-backed Internet Banking invoice payments
- Admin tools for members, shared-email-aware CSV import, bookings, bed
  allocation, payments, seasons, policies, reports, email, audit logs, issue
  reports, waitlist, lodge settings, Xero operations, and hut leaders, with
  contextual help popups on Admin and Finance pages
- Admin date override for bookings the normal edit window locks (an in-progress
  or fully-past stay): a Full Admin or Booking Officer can move the dates only,
  choosing either **Shift** (keep the price and night count — no fee, refund, or
  Xero activity) or **Recalculate** (reprice at season rates). A Recalculate
  whose new (or unchanged past) check-in falls on or before the Xero
  organisation lock date is rejected with unlock instructions — the same
  lock-date guard as retroactive creation; Shift is exempt because it writes no
  Xero documents. Moving onto full
  nights requires an explicit over-capacity confirmation, and every override is
  audited and linked to any approved change request
- Retroactive booking creation for a stay that already happened: a Full Admin or
  Booking Officer can create a booking on behalf of a member with a past
  check-in (up to 365 days back), guarded by the Xero organisation lock dates
  (the check-in must clear the locked period, unlock it in Xero to proceed),
  with over-capacity nights allowed via an explicit confirmation, an explicit
  per-create choice of whether to email the member, and full audit metadata
- Admin-editable public website pages and footer sections with sanitised HTML
  content, embed/text tokens where supported, and a menu generated from page
  settings (see `CONFIGURATION.md`, "Website Page Content" and "Website Site
  Content"); every admin rich-text editor includes a token help button listing
  the tokens it supports
- Admin-managed site banners (urgent/warning/notify) shown above the site
  header for a set NZ date window, dismissible per browser
- Lodge kiosk with PIN access, week-at-a-glance counts, arrivals/departures,
  chores, and issue reporting
- Xero integrations for operational accounting, Internet Banking settlement,
  and finance reports backed by the same operational Xero connection
- AWS SES email, SES SNS suppression feedback, Sentry/pino observability, cron
  jobs, PostgreSQL backups, and blue/green Docker deployment

## Adopting This For Your Club

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the required local variables listed in
   `CONFIGURATION.md`.
2. Copy `config/club.example.json` to `config/club.json` and replace the club
   name, contact emails, public URL, beds, age tiers, and integer-cent rates.
   If `config/club.json` is absent, the app falls back to
   `config/club.example.json`.
3. Complete `/admin/site-style` after first sign-in to set public colours,
   fonts, and the database-stored logo. Replace the remaining images in
   `public/branding/` with your own favicon, Open Graph image, and public
   website photos. Keep the `*.example.*` files as reusable placeholders for
   forks.
4. Set `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, and `SEED_LODGE_PASSWORD`,
   run the seed command, then change the seeded admin password on first login.
5. After sign-in, use **Admin > Modules** to set club-level activation for
   optional modules. Kiosk, chores, finance dashboard, waitlist, Xero, bed
   allocation, multiple lodges, Internet Banking payments, address autocomplete,
   two-factor authentication, and Google Analytics default off until an admin enables
   them. General-purpose modules default on and can be disabled there.
6. Use **Admin > Members** to assign access roles. `Full Admin` keeps all
   admin permissions and is never editable; `Read-only Admin`,
   `Booking Officer`, `Membership Officer`, `Treasurer`, `Finance Viewer`, and
   `Content Manager` are seeded permission bundles that can be combined on one
   login-enabled member for custom access. Use **Admin > Access Roles**
   (Full Admin only) to rename them, adjust their per-area permissions, delete
   unused ones, or create brand-new roles.
7. Use **Admin > Membership Types** to review the seeded seasonal membership
   types in the ordered list, then open a type editor to adjust its settings:
   Full, Associate, Life, School, Non-Member, and Family. Associate is the
   built-in Associate/Reserve-style type and can be renamed by the club.
   These records drive season-aware booking policy (`MEMBER_RATE`,
   `NON_MEMBER_RATE`, `BLOCK_BOOKING`) and subscription policy (`REQUIRED`,
   `NOT_REQUIRED`) without granting app access. Admins can also configure the
   age tiers allowed for each type and optional membership-type Xero contact
   group rules. Admins assign a member's seasonal type from that member's admin
   detail page, with an optional date-only **apply from** changeover, after
   previewing affected future bookings, drafts, waitlist records, and
   subscription history;
   existing future bookings are not automatically repriced by this change.
8. Use **Admin > Committee** to review seeded committee master roles and
   member-linked committee assignments. Assignments remain hidden/unpublished
   until an admin explicitly enables their presentation flags; public contact
   options use only published, contactable assignments. Each contactable
   assignment chooses per assignment whether messages route to the committee
   **role** email alias, the linked **member's** own email, or a **custom**
   address; when the selected address is blank the delivery falls back to the
   role alias and then the member's personal email so contact mail is never
   lost. Phone numbers display only when **show phone** is enabled.
9. Use test/demo credentials for Stripe, Xero, SES, and Sentry until you are
   ready for a controlled deployment of your own environment.

You can use the setup helpers for a guided path:

```bash
npm run setup:check
npm run setup:wizard
```

The CLI only writes `config/club.json`. API keys, OAuth secrets, SMTP secrets,
and deployment secrets stay in environment variables. After migrations and seed
data are in place, log in as an admin and finish the in-app checklist at
`/admin/setup`, using the setup hub cards for booking policy, finance,
membership cancellation, email, and provider readiness settings. Finance report
mappings live in the Finance drill-down at `/admin/setup/finance` and are
collapsed by default. Admin Setup and Admin Notifications also expose the
editable lifecycle email templates and delivery policies used for membership
cancellation, archive, and safe-delete review alerts. Emails also inherit their
brand palette from the club theme set in `/admin/site-style` (via a cache that
refreshes at most every five minutes), so they match the live site; see
`CONFIGURATION.md` → Branding Assets.

See `CONFIGURATION.md` for the full environment and `config/club.json` schema
reference.

## Fresh Clone Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thatskiff33/AlpineClubBookingsNZ.git
cd AlpineClubBookingsNZ
cp .env.example .env
cp config/club.example.json config/club.json
npm ci
npx prisma generate
npm run setup:check
```

Edit `.env` before running the app. For a local database-backed setup, set at
least `DATABASE_URL`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`,
`NEXTAUTH_URL`, `CRON_SECRET`, `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, and
`SEED_LODGE_PASSWORD`. External integrations can use test/demo credentials or
remain blank unless the feature under test requires them.

For a Docker-only local boot using example config, use the staging Compose
target:

```bash
cp .env.staging.example .env.staging
docker compose --env-file .env.staging -p tacbookings-staging \
  -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d --build postgres app
docker compose --env-file .env.staging -p tacbookings-staging \
  -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.staging.yml run --rm migrate
docker compose --env-file .env.staging -p tacbookings-staging \
  -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.staging.yml exec app npx tsx prisma/seed.ts
```

The seed data creates the first admin account from those `SEED_ADMIN_*`
variables and marks it for password change on first login, and the shared
lodge kiosk account from `SEED_LODGE_PASSWORD`. It also creates or repairs
the matching normalized `MemberAccessRole.ADMIN` and `MemberAccessRole.LODGE`
rows for those seeded accounts. Change those passwords immediately in any
shared or persistent environment.

The Docker-only app listens on `http://localhost:3001` by default.

If you prefer `npm run dev`, run a local PostgreSQL server that matches
`DATABASE_URL`, then apply migrations and seed from the host:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.org \
SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-local-password \
SEED_LODGE_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-local-kiosk-password \
  npm run db:seed
npm run dev
```

For richer local-only demo data, run the destructive demo seed only against a
throwaway PostgreSQL database on a development machine. Never run it on a
deployment host, including hosts where production PostgreSQL is reachable via
`localhost`. The command requires an explicit opt-in, refuses
`NODE_ENV=production`, refuses non-local `DATABASE_URL` hosts, and refuses to
run when any existing `Member` email is outside `demo.alpineclub.test`:

```bash
ALLOW_DEMO_SEED=1 npm run db:seed:demo
```

The demo seed clears demo and transactional rows before rebuilding sample
members, bookings, payments, requests, credits, inductions, and public booking
requests. It does not contain live provider credentials. Demo users use
`demo1234` unless `DEMO_SEED_PASSWORD` is set.

## Daily Commands

```bash
npm audit --audit-level=high
npm run lint
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/tacbookings npx prisma validate
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

Browser E2E tests for the Critical journeys run separately against the staging
compose stack: `npm run test:e2e` (see `docs/E2E_PLAYWRIGHT.md`).

`npm test` includes property-based tests (fast-check) for the pure money math —
pricing, promo discounts, refund tiers, change fees, member credit, and the
Xero booking-edit settlement classifier — in
`src/lib/policies/__tests__/*.property.test.ts` and
`src/lib/__tests__/xero-settlement.property.test.ts`. They enforce the
`docs/DOMAIN_INVARIANTS.md` "Money" rules as universally-quantified properties
(integer cents, refund + retained = paid, deterministic repricing, no negative
charge or refund totals — booking-edit components stay signed and sum to the
net, #1356).

This repository uses a current Next.js version. Before changing framework APIs,
read the relevant versioned guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`.

## For Maintainers

Use the public repository for generic AlpineClubBookingsNZ work and a private deployment
fork for club-specific configuration, branding, and production release work.

- Generic feature or fix: branch from public `main`, open a public PR, merge
  after CI, then pull public `main` into the private deployment fork and deploy
  from that fork.
- Club-specific change: branch, review, merge, and deploy inside the private
  fork. Keep private configuration, operational copy, service identifiers, and
  club data out of the public upstream.
- Production hotfix: fix and deploy from the private fork first, then port any
  generic part back to the public upstream in a separate PR.

CI should run in both repositories. Public CI should use
`config/club.example.json` and placeholder assets; private CI should use the
private fork's real `config/club.json`, private assets, and private CI secrets.

See `docs/ONGOING_DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` for the full maintainer workflow.

## Docker

Build the production image locally:

```bash
docker build -t tacbookings:local .
```

Run the full Compose stack for production-style testing:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose run --rm migrate
docker compose ps
```

For accessibility or release-review checks, use the non-production staging
target:

```bash
cp .env.staging.example .env.staging
docker compose --env-file .env.staging -p tacbookings-staging \
  -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d --build postgres app
```

See `docs/STAGING_ACCESSIBILITY.md` for the staging URL, auth path, and
Lighthouse workflow.

## Deployment

Production deployment is documented as a reference in `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
The supported AlpineClubBookingsNZ deployment path uses the single blue/green
production deploy script:

```bash
./scripts/run-production-blue-green-deploy.sh
```

On `main`, GitHub Actions builds and publishes the app and migration images to
GHCR with commit-SHA tags. The production deploy script resolves `origin/main`,
pulls those exact images, re-enters its internal deploy-engine mode, runs
migrations, and switches Caddy after health checks pass.

The public image packages are `alpineclubbookingsnz-app` for the runnable web
application and `alpineclubbookingsnz-migrate` for Prisma migration runs.

Do not use live Stripe, Xero, SES, Sentry, or production database credentials in
forks or public CI. Configure your own service accounts and secrets.
