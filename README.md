# AlpineClubBookingsNZ

AlpineClubBookingsNZ is an open-source booking, membership, payment, lodge, and finance
platform for small clubs. It is published as a real-world reference
implementation for a production Next.js application with payments, accounting,
email, scheduled jobs, and Docker-based deployment.

AlpineClubBookingsNZ is the open-source booking system originally built for and deployed
at [Tokoroa Alpine Club](https://tokoroa.org.nz).

The code is MIT licensed. Project branding, logos, copy, domains, and
operational content are included for context only; replace them before using a
fork for another organisation. See `NOTICE.md`.

## What It Does

- Member registration, profile management, family/dependent relationships, and
  membership nomination workflows
- Bed-capacity booking flow with date-only New Zealand lodge nights, waitlist,
  non-member holds, booking changes, cancellation rules, refunds, credits,
  promo codes, and Stripe payments
- Admin tools for members, bookings, payments, seasons, policies, reports,
  email, audit logs, issue reports, waitlist, lodge, and hut leaders
- Lodge kiosk with PIN access, arrivals/departures, chores, and issue reporting
- Xero integrations for operational accounting plus a separate finance Xero
  boundary and finance reports
- AWS SES email, SES SNS suppression feedback, Sentry/pino observability, cron
  jobs, PostgreSQL backups, and blue/green Docker deployment

## Stack

- Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, TypeScript
- PostgreSQL 16 and Prisma 6
- Auth.js / NextAuth credentials sessions
- Stripe PaymentIntents, SetupIntents, and webhooks
- Xero OAuth, webhooks, retry queues, local caches, and metering
- AWS SES email and S3 backup storage
- Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Recharts, Vitest, ESLint
- Docker Compose and Caddy for production-style deployment

## Requirements

- Node.js 24 LTS
- npm 11 or newer
- Docker and Docker Compose for local PostgreSQL or production-style runs

## Adopting This For Your Club

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the required local variables listed in
   `CONFIGURATION.md`.
2. Copy `config/club.example.json` to `config/club.json` and replace the club
   name, contact emails, public URL, beds, age tiers, and integer-cent rates.
   If `config/club.json` is absent, the app falls back to
   `config/club.example.json`.
3. Replace the images in `public/branding/` with your own logo, favicon, Open
   Graph image, and public website photos. Keep the `*.example.*` files as
   reusable placeholders for forks.
4. Set deploy capability flags in `.env`: `FEATURE_KIOSK`,
   `FEATURE_CHORES`, `FEATURE_FINANCE_DASHBOARD`, `FEATURE_WAITLIST`, and
   `FEATURE_XERO_INTEGRATION`. Only the literal value `true` makes a module
   available to the deployment.
5. Set `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, run the seed command, then
   change the seeded admin password on first login.
6. After sign-in, use **Admin > Modules** to set club-level activation for
   optional modules. Optional modules are active only when both the `.env`
   capability and the Admin Modules activation are enabled.
7. Use test/demo credentials for Stripe, Xero, SES, and Sentry until you are
   ready for a controlled deployment of your own environment.

You can use the setup helpers for a guided path:

```bash
npm run setup:check
npm run setup:wizard
```

The CLI only writes `config/club.json`. API keys, OAuth secrets, SMTP secrets,
and deployment secrets stay in environment variables. After migrations and seed
data are in place, log in as an admin and finish the in-app checklist at
`/admin/setup`, including booking policy, membership cancellation, email, and
provider readiness settings.

See `CONFIGURATION.md` for the full environment and `config/club.json` schema
reference.

## Fresh Clone Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thatskiff33/AlpineClubBookingsNZ.git
cd AlpineClubBookingsNZ
cp .env.example .env
cp config/club.example.json config/club.json
npm ci
npx prisma generate
npm run setup:check
```

Edit `.env` before running the app. For a local database-backed setup, set at
least `DATABASE_URL`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`,
`NEXTAUTH_URL`, `CRON_SECRET`, `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL`, and
`SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. External integrations can use test/demo credentials or
remain blank unless the feature under test requires them.

For a Docker-only local boot using example config, use the staging Compose
target:

```bash
cp .env.staging.example .env.staging
docker compose --env-file .env.staging -p tacbookings-staging \
  -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d --build postgres app
docker compose --env-file .env.staging -p tacbookings-staging \
  -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.staging.yml run --rm migrate
docker compose --env-file .env.staging -p tacbookings-staging \
  -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.staging.yml exec app npx tsx prisma/seed.ts
```

The seed data creates the first admin account from those `SEED_ADMIN_*`
variables and marks it for password change on first login. Change that password
immediately in any shared or persistent environment.

The Docker-only app listens on `http://localhost:3001` by default.

If you prefer `npm run dev`, run a local PostgreSQL server that matches
`DATABASE_URL`, then apply migrations and seed from the host:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.org \
SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-local-password \
  npm run db:seed
npm run dev
```

## Daily Commands

```bash
npm audit --audit-level=high
npm run lint
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/tacbookings npx prisma validate
npm test
npm run build
```

This repository uses a current Next.js version. Before changing framework APIs,
read the relevant versioned guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`.

## For Maintainers

Use the public repository for generic AlpineClubBookingsNZ work and a private deployment
fork for club-specific configuration, branding, and production release work.

- Generic feature or fix: branch from public `main`, open a public PR, merge
  after CI, then pull public `main` into the private deployment fork and deploy
  from that fork.
- Club-specific change: branch, review, merge, and deploy inside the private
  fork. Keep private configuration, operational copy, service identifiers, and
  club data out of the public upstream.
- Production hotfix: fix and deploy from the private fork first, then port any
  generic part back to the public upstream in a separate PR.

CI should run in both repositories. Public CI should use
`config/club.example.json` and placeholder assets; private CI should use the
private fork's real `config/club.json`, private assets, and private CI secrets.

See `docs/ONGOING-DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md` for the full maintainer workflow.

## Docker

Build the production image locally:

```bash
docker build -t tacbookings:local .
```

Run the full Compose stack for production-style testing:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose run --rm migrate
docker compose ps
```

For accessibility or release-review checks, use the non-production staging
target:

```bash
cp .env.staging.example .env.staging
docker compose --env-file .env.staging -p tacbookings-staging \
  -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d --build postgres app
```

See `docs/STAGING_ACCESSIBILITY.md` for the staging URL, auth path, and
Lighthouse workflow.

## Deployment

Production deployment is documented as a reference in `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
The supported AlpineClubBookingsNZ deployment path uses the blue/green wrapper:

```bash
./scripts/run-production-blue-green-deploy.sh
```

On `main`, GitHub Actions builds and publishes the app and migration images to
GHCR with commit-SHA tags. The production wrapper resolves `origin/main`, pulls
those exact images, runs migrations, and switches Caddy after health checks
pass.

The public image packages are `alpineclubbookingsnz-app` for the runnable web
application and `alpineclubbookingsnz-migrate` for Prisma migration runs.

Do not use live Stripe, Xero, SES, Sentry, or production database credentials in
forks or public CI. Configure your own service accounts and secrets.
