# TACBookings

TACBookings is the Tokoroa Alpine Club booking, membership, payment, lodge, and
finance platform. It is published as a real-world reference implementation for
a small club running a production Next.js application with payments,
accounting, email, scheduled jobs, and Docker-based deployment.

The code is MIT licensed. Tokoroa Alpine Club branding, logos, copy, domains,
and operational content are included for context only; replace them before
using a fork for another organisation. See `NOTICE.md`.

## What It Does

- Member registration, profile management, family/dependent relationships, and
  membership nomination workflows
- Bed-capacity booking flow with date-only New Zealand lodge nights, waitlist,
  non-member holds, booking changes, cancellation rules, refunds, credits,
  promo codes, and Stripe payments
- Admin tools for members, bookings, payments, seasons, policies, reports,
  email, audit logs, issue reports, waitlist, lodge, and hut leaders
- Lodge kiosk with PIN access, arrivals/departures, chores, and issue reporting
- Xero integrations for operational accounting plus a separate finance Xero
  boundary and finance reports
- AWS SES email, SES SNS suppression feedback, Sentry/pino observability, cron
  jobs, PostgreSQL backups, and blue/green Docker deployment

## Stack

- Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, TypeScript
- PostgreSQL 16 and Prisma 6
- Auth.js / NextAuth credentials sessions
- Stripe PaymentIntents, SetupIntents, and webhooks
- Xero OAuth, webhooks, retry queues, local caches, and metering
- AWS SES email and S3 backup storage
- Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Recharts, Vitest, ESLint
- Docker Compose and Caddy for production-style deployment

## Requirements

- Node.js 24 LTS
- npm 11 or newer
- Docker and Docker Compose for local PostgreSQL or production-style runs

## Fresh Clone Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thatskiff33/TACBookings.git
cd TACBookings
cp .env.example .env
npm ci
npx prisma generate
```

Edit `.env` before running the app. For a local database-backed setup, set at
least `DATABASE_URL`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`,
`NEXTAUTH_URL`, and `CRON_SECRET`. External integrations can use test/demo
credentials or remain blank unless the feature under test requires them.

Start PostgreSQL, apply migrations, and seed local data:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
```

The seed data includes a local admin account:

```text
support@tokoroa.org.nz / admin123
```

Change that password immediately in any shared or persistent environment.

Start the app only in local or non-production environments:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Daily Commands

```bash
npm audit --audit-level=high
npm run lint
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/tacbookings npx prisma validate
npm test
npm run build
```

This repository uses a current Next.js version. Before changing framework APIs,
read the relevant versioned guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`.

## Docker

Build the production image locally:

```bash
docker build -t tacbookings:local .
```

Run the full Compose stack for production-style testing:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose run --rm migrate
docker compose ps
```

For accessibility or release-review checks, use the non-production staging
target:

```bash
cp .env.staging.example .env.staging
docker compose --env-file .env.staging -p tacbookings-staging \
  -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d --build postgres app
```

See `docs/STAGING_ACCESSIBILITY.md` for the staging URL, auth path, and
Lighthouse workflow.

## Deployment

Production deployment is documented as a reference in `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
The supported TACBookings deployment path uses the blue/green wrapper:

```bash
./scripts/run-production-blue-green-deploy.sh
```

Do not use live Stripe, Xero, SES, Sentry, or production database credentials in
forks or public CI. Configure your own service accounts and secrets.
