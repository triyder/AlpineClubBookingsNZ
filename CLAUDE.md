# TACBookings - Build Plan

## Build Status

### Phases 1-4: MERGED INTO MAIN

All four build phases have been merged into `main` in sequence, with all conflicts resolved.

**What has been built:**

1. **Phase 1: Foundation** - Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, Prisma schema (all entities), NextAuth v5 credentials auth with JWT sessions, password reset flow, member profile, admin layout with sidebar, Docker Compose + Caddy setup
2. **Phase 2: Seasons & Pricing** - Admin seasons CRUD (`/admin/seasons`), cancellation policy management (`/admin/cancellation-policy`), pricing engine with full test coverage (getStayNights, findSeasonForDate, getNightlyRate, calculateBookingPrice, calculatePromoDiscount, calculateRefund, formatCents, getSeasonYear)
3. **Phase 3: Core Booking** - Availability calculator (29-bed capacity), booking wizard (`/book`), guest forms, booking API routes (create, quote, cancel, availability), my bookings list + detail pages, admin bookings page with filters
4. **Phase 4: Stripe Payments** - PaymentIntents for confirmed bookings, SetupIntents for pending bookings (save card, charge later), Stripe webhook handler, cancellation with policy-based refunds, Stripe React components (PaymentForm, SetupForm, StripeProvider)

5. **Phase 8: Chore Roster** - ChoreTemplate schema extended (recommendedPeopleMin/Max, isEssential, ageRestriction enum, conditionalNote), 17 chore templates seeded, auto-suggest allocation algorithm with round-robin/age restrictions/4-day history lookback/occupancy scaling, admin chores CRUD (`/admin/chores`), admin roster review (`/admin/roster`) with date picker/reassignment/confirm, printable A4 roster (`/admin/roster/[date]/print`), roster email to guests, 39 chore allocator tests

**How to run:**
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npx prisma generate
npm test              # 160 tests pass (8 test files)
npm run build         # builds successfully
```

**To seed database (requires running PostgreSQL):**
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name initial
npm run db:seed
```

**Test accounts (from seed):**
- Admin: admin@tac.org.nz / admin123
- Member: member@tac.org.nz / member123

**Known considerations:**
- nodemailer v8 has peer dep conflict with next-auth (use `--legacy-peer-deps`)
- Prisma v6 (not v7) - standard PostgreSQL compatible
- All prices stored as integer cents
- Season year: April-March cycle
- No migrations committed yet - run `prisma migrate dev` to create initial migration from merged schema

### What's Next: Phase 5 - Non-Member Guests & Bumping
1. Non-member guest flow in booking wizard
2. PENDING status for non-member bookings >7 days out
3. Cron job to auto-confirm pending bookings at 7-day mark
4. FIFO bumping algorithm when members fill lodge
5. Charge saved PaymentMethod on confirmation
6. Bumped booking notification emails

## Context

Tokoroa Alpine Club (TAC) is a not-for-profit operating a 29-bed alpine lodge. They currently use Checkfront for booking management and Xero for accounting/membership. They want to replace Checkfront with a bespoke booking and membership system that integrates deeply with Xero and Stripe. The club has ~410 members (310 adult, 60 youth, 40 child), no developers on the team - building entirely with LLM assistance. Hosted on AWS Lightsail.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Framework** | Next.js 15 (App Router) | Full-stack TypeScript monolith. Largest LLM training corpus. Single codebase for frontend + API |
| **Language** | TypeScript | Type safety catches errors at compile time. LLMs generate excellent TS |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 16 | Robust relational DB, handles bookings/members/payments well. Free on Lightsail |
| **ORM** | Prisma | Type-safe DB access, declarative schema = self-documenting, auto migrations |
| **Auth** | NextAuth.js v5 (Auth.js) | Credentials provider (email+password), JWT sessions, built-in password reset |
| **UI** | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui | Production-quality components without design skills. LLMs produce excellent Tailwind |
| **Payments** | Stripe (PaymentIntents + SetupIntents) | Industry standard, Xero has native Stripe feed |
| **Accounting** | Xero API via `xero-node` SDK | Full bidirectional sync: invoices, contacts, payments |
| **Email** | AWS SES via `nodemailer` (or Resend) | Already on AWS. Transactional emails for confirmations, resets, notifications |
| **Deployment** | Docker Compose on Lightsail | Single `docker compose up` deploys everything |
| **Reverse Proxy** | Caddy 2 | Automatic HTTPS via Let's Encrypt. Two-line config |
| **Scheduled Jobs** | `node-cron` in Next.js `instrumentation.ts` | No external scheduler needed for this scale |

**Why NOT alternatives:**
- Django/Rails: Two-language problem (Python/Ruby + JS for frontend)
- Microservices: Massively over-engineered for 410 users
- Separate React SPA + Express: Two codebases instead of one
- Supabase/Firebase: Adds vendor lock-in, another abstraction layer

## Architecture Overview

```
Internet
    |
    v
[Caddy - auto HTTPS, ports 80/443]
    |
    v
[Next.js App - port 3000]
    |
    v
[PostgreSQL 16 - port 5432]

External Services:
  - Stripe (payments + webhooks)
  - Xero (accounting + webhooks)
  - AWS SES (transactional email)
```

All three services run via Docker Compose on a single Lightsail instance ($10-20/mo, 2GB RAM).

### Key Relationships
- Member -> many Bookings, many MemberSubscriptions, many PromoRedemptions
- Booking -> many BookingGuests, one Payment, many ChoreAssignments
- Season -> many SeasonRates
- ChoreTemplate -> many ChoreAssignments

## Core Business Logic

### 1. Booking Flow
1. Member selects dates on availability calendar
2. System shows available beds (29 minus confirmed guests per night in range)
3. Member adds themselves + guests (name, age tier, member/non-member)
4. System calculates price: look up SeasonRate for each guest's ageTier + isMember for each night
5. Member optionally applies promo code
6. **If all guests are members OR checkIn <= 7 days away**: status = CONFIRMED, collect Stripe payment immediately
7. **If any guest is non-member AND checkIn > 7 days away**: status = PENDING, collect card details via Stripe SetupIntent (no charge yet), set `nonMemberHoldUntil = checkIn - 7 days`

### 2. Non-Member Priority Bumping (FIFO - last booked = first bumped)
When a member creates a booking that would fill the lodge past 29 beds on any night:
1. Find all PENDING bookings overlapping those nights
2. Sort by `createdAt DESC` (most recent first)
3. Bump bookings one at a time until capacity is restored
4. For each bumped booking: set status = BUMPED, send notification email
5. No refund needed (payment wasn't taken for PENDING bookings)

### 3. Pending Booking Confirmation (Cron - runs every few hours)
1. Find PENDING bookings where `nonMemberHoldUntil <= now()`
2. Re-check availability for each
3. If beds available: charge saved PaymentMethod via Stripe, set CONFIRMED, create Xero invoice, email confirmation
4. If beds no longer available: set BUMPED, email notification

### 4. Pricing Engine
- For each night in stay: determine which Season it falls in, look up SeasonRate for guest's ageTier + isMember
- All prices stored as integer cents (e.g. $45.50 = 4550)
- Promo code application: FREE_NIGHTS (subtract cheapest N nights), PERCENTAGE (% off total), FIXED_AMOUNT (flat $ off)

### 5. Cancellation & Refunds
- Admin-configurable policy: e.g. 14+ days = 100% refund, 7-14 days = 50%, <7 days = 0%
- Members cancel from their booking detail page
- System calculates refund based on policy, processes Stripe refund, creates Xero credit note

### 6. Chore Roster
- Admin configures chore templates (name, recommended people count, min age)
- For a given date, system auto-suggests assignments using round-robin across all confirmed guests
- Hut leader reviews on admin panel, can reassign/edit
- Confirms roster - status changes from SUGGESTED to CONFIRMED
- Printable A4 page: clean table with guest names, assigned chores, date - CSS `@media print` styling

### 7. Xero Integration (Full Bidirectional Sync)

**OAuth2 Flow:**
1. Admin clicks "Connect Xero" in admin panel
2. Redirects to Xero authorization
3. Callback stores encrypted access + refresh tokens
4. Auto-refresh before 30-min expiry

**Xero -> TAC (Membership Verification):**
- Daily cron + on-login check: query Xero for member's contact by `xeroContactId`
- Check for paid invoices matching current season subscription
- Update MemberSubscription status
- Season year logic: if current month >= April, seasonYear = currentYear; else seasonYear = currentYear - 1

**TAC -> Xero (Booking Invoices):**
- On CONFIRMED + payment succeeded:
  1. Find or create Xero Contact for the member
  2. Create Xero Invoice with line items (per guest, per night, showing rates)
  3. Record payment against the invoice
  4. Store xeroInvoiceId on Payment record

**Refund Sync:**
- Stripe refund webhook -> create Xero credit note against original invoice

## Email Notifications

| Event | Recipient | Content |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Registration | New member | Welcome email |
| Password reset | Member | Reset link (1hr expiry) |
| Booking confirmed | Booking member | Dates, guests, total, payment receipt |
| Booking pending | Booking member | Dates, guests, explanation of hold period |
| Pending -> confirmed | Booking member | Payment taken, confirmation details |
| Booking bumped | Booking member | Apology, explanation, rebooking link |
| Booking cancelled | Booking member | Cancellation confirmation, refund amount |
| Chore roster | All guests for date | Their assigned chores for the day |
| Admin: new booking | Admin | Notification of new booking |
| Admin: capacity warning | Admin | Lodge nearly full for upcoming dates |
| Admin: pending approaching deadline | Admin | Non-member bookings about to auto-confirm |

6. Security audit (rate limiting, input validation, CSRF)
7. User acceptance testing with club committee
8. Member data import from Checkfront/Xero

## Key Design Decisions

- **All prices in cents as integers** - prevents floating point rounding bugs with money
- **Timezone: Pacific/Auckland (NZST/NZDT)** - all dates stored as date-only (no time) since bookings are per-night. Server timezone set to NZ
- **JWT sessions (not database sessions)** - 410 members, simple roles. 24hr expiry with refresh. Trade-off: can't instantly revoke, but acceptable at this scale
- **Capacity-based booking (not room-based)** - members book beds, admin assigns rooms separately if needed. Simplifies the booking engine significantly
- **Season year = April to March** - if current month >= April, seasonYear = currentYear; else seasonYear = currentYear - 1

## Verification & Testing

- **Unit tests**: Pricing engine, availability calculator, bumping algorithm, chore allocator (use Vitest)
- **Integration tests**: Booking flow end-to-end, Stripe webhook handling, Xero sync
- **Manual testing**: Each phase deployed and tested on Lightsail before proceeding
- **UAT**: Club committee tests before go-live with real member data
- **Stripe test mode**: Use Stripe test keys throughout development, switch to live keys at go-live
- **Xero demo company**: Test against Xero demo org before connecting production

## Development Workflow: How to Build This with Claude

### Overview

The build uses a **session-per-phase** approach. Each session focuses on one build phase, runs autonomously with minimal interruption, and hands off cleanly to the next session via CLAUDE.md. Within each session, Claude uses sub-agents in parallel where modules are independent.

### Step 1: Configure Claude Code for Autonomous Work

Create `.claude/settings.json` in the project root to pre-approve safe commands so Claude doesn't ask permission for every npm/git/prisma operation:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(npm *)",
      "Bash(npx *)",
      "Bash(node *)",
      "Bash(git add *)",
      "Bash(git commit *)",
      "Bash(git push *)",
      "Bash(git status*)",
      "Bash(git diff*)",
      "Bash(git log*)",
      "Bash(docker compose *)",
      "Bash(mkdir *)",
      "Bash(ls *)",
      "Bash(cat *)",
      "Bash(cp *)",
      "Bash(mv *)",
      "Bash(rm -rf node_modules)",
      "Bash(rm -rf .next)",
      "Read(*)",
      "Edit(*)",
      "Write(*)",
      "Glob(*)",
      "Grep(*)"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Bash(rm -rf /)*",
      "Bash(rm -rf .git)*"
    ]
  }
}
```

This eliminates ~90% of permission prompts. Claude can freely create files, install packages, run builds/tests, commit, and push without stopping to ask.

### Step 2: Structure CLAUDE.md for Session Handoff

The CLAUDE.md in the repo root is the **single source of truth** that any new Claude session reads first. It must always contain:

1. **What the project is** (context, requirements) - already written
2. **What has been built so far** - updated at end of each session
3. **What to build next** - the next phase's scope
4. **How to run/test it** - commands that work right now
5. **Known issues / decisions made** - so Claude doesn't re-litigate settled decisions

At the end of each build session, tell Claude: **"Update CLAUDE.md with what was built, what works, and what's next. Commit and push."**

### Step 3: Add Path-Scoped Rules for Focused Context

Create `.claude/rules/` directory with files that only load when Claude touches files in matching paths:

**`.claude/rules/database.md`** (loads when touching `prisma/**`):
```
- All prices stored as integer cents (e.g. $45.50 = 4550)
- Use Prisma transactions for any multi-table writes
- Always add indexes on foreign keys and commonly queried fields
- Season year: if month >= April, year = currentYear; else year = currentYear - 1
```

**`.claude/rules/api.md`** (loads when touching `src/app/api/**`):
```
- Validate all inputs with Zod schemas
- Return consistent error shape: { error: string, details?: any }
- Always check auth via auth() helper before processing
- Admin routes must verify role === ADMIN
```

**`.claude/rules/stripe.md`** (loads when touching `src/lib/stripe*`):
```
- Always verify Stripe webhook signatures
- Use PaymentIntents for confirmed bookings, SetupIntents for pending
- Store all Stripe IDs for reconciliation
- Handle idempotency - webhooks may fire multiple times
```

**`.claude/rules/testing.md`** (loads when touching `**/*.test.*`):
```
- Use Vitest for all tests
- Test business logic (pricing, availability, bumping) thoroughly
- Mock Stripe and Xero API calls in tests
- Every new lib/ function should have tests before the session ends
```

### Step 4: Session-per-Phase Execution

Each phase = one Claude Code session. Here's how to run each:

**Starting a session (your prompt to Claude):**
```
Read CLAUDE.md. Build Phase [N]: [Phase Name].

Build everything in this phase autonomously. Write tests for all
business logic. Commit after each major milestone. When done, update
CLAUDE.md with what was built, commands to run/test, and what's next.
Push all commits.
```

That's it. Claude reads the plan, knows the full context, builds the phase, tests it, commits, and updates the handoff doc. You review the output at the end.

**What Claude does autonomously within a session:**
- Reads CLAUDE.md and the phase requirements
- Creates files, installs dependencies
- Writes implementation code
- Writes tests and runs them
- Fixes failing tests
- Commits at milestones (e.g. "Add Prisma schema and seed", "Add auth with NextAuth")
- Updates CLAUDE.md at the end
- Pushes to the branch

**When Claude SHOULD interrupt you:**
- Ambiguous requirements (e.g. "should promo codes stack?")
- Architecture decisions not covered in the plan
- External service setup needed (e.g. "I need your Stripe test API key")
- A persistent bug it can't resolve after 2-3 attempts

### Step 5: Security & Quality Checkpoints

After each phase is built, run a dedicated **review session** before moving to the next phase:

```
Read CLAUDE.md. Review Phase [N] code for:
1. Security vulnerabilities (OWASP top 10, input validation, auth bypass)
2. Business logic correctness (edge cases in pricing, bumping, availability)
3. Error handling (what happens when Stripe/Xero is down?)
4. Test coverage gaps
5. Code quality (duplication, unnecessary complexity)

Fix any issues found. Do NOT add features or refactor beyond what's needed.
Commit fixes and push.
```

### Step 6: Parallel Sub-Agents Within Sessions

Claude automatically uses sub-agents for independent work within a session. For example, during Phase 3 (Core Booking), Claude might:
- **Agent 1**: Build the availability calculator + tests
- **Agent 2**: Build the booking calendar UI component
- **Agent 3**: Research the best date-range picker library for the stack

These run in parallel, then Claude integrates the results. You don't need to orchestrate this - Claude decides when parallelism helps.

### Recommended Session Sequence

| Session | Phase | Prompt | Duration |
|---------|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Foundation | "Build Phase 1: Foundation" | ~30-45 min |
| 1R | Review | "Review Phase 1 for security and correctness" | ~15 min |
| 2 | Seasons & Pricing | "Build Phase 2: Seasons & Pricing" | ~20 min |
| 3 | Core Booking | "Build Phase 3: Core Booking" | ~45 min |
| 3R | Review | "Review Phases 2-3 for security and correctness" | ~15 min |
| 4 | Payments | "Build Phase 4: Stripe Payments" | ~30 min |
| 4R | Review | "Review Phase 4 - payment security is critical" | ~15 min |
| 5 | Non-Member + Bumping | "Build Phase 5: Non-Member Guests & Bumping" | ~30 min |
| 5R | Review | "Review Phase 5 bumping logic edge cases" | ~15 min |
| 6 | Xero Integration | "Build Phase 6: Xero Integration" | ~30 min |
| 7 | Promo Codes | "Build Phase 7: Promo Codes & Discounts" | ~20 min |
| 8 | Chore Roster | "Build Phase 8: Chore Roster" | ~30 min |
| 8R | Review | "Full security and integration review of all phases" | ~20 min |
| 9 | Polish | "Build Phase 9: Polish & Production Hardening" | ~30 min |

**Total: ~15 sessions, mostly hands-off.** You review output between sessions and provide any missing info (API keys, domain name, etc).

### What You Need to Provide (Once, Before Starting)

Before Phase 1, gather these. Claude will ask for them when needed but having them ready avoids interruptions:

1. **Domain name** for the booking system
2. **Stripe account** - sign up at stripe.com, get test API keys from dashboard
3. **Xero app** - register at developer.xero.com, get client ID and secret
4. **AWS SES** - verify your sending domain in SES console (or use Resend as alternative - simpler setup)
5. **Lightsail instance** - provision a 2GB Ubuntu 24.04 instance, attach a static IP, note the IP address
6. **Club logo** (optional) - PNG/SVG for the booking site header

### Recovery: When Things Go Wrong

If a session produces broken code:
```
Read CLAUDE.md. The last session left the build in a broken state.
Run `npm run build` and `npm test` to see what's failing.
Fix all errors without changing working functionality.
Commit and push when green.
```

If you want to restart a phase from scratch:
```
Read CLAUDE.md. Revert Phase [N] commits and rebuild Phase [N]
from the beginning using a different approach for [specific issue].
```

### Hooks for Auto-Formatting (Optional)

Add to `.claude/settings.json` to auto-format code after every edit:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "npx prettier --write \"$CLAUDE_FILE_PATH\" 2>/dev/null || true"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "npx prettier --write \"$CLAUDE_FILE_PATH\" 2>/dev/null || true"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
