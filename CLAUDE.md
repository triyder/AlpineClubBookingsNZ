# TACBookings - Build Plan

## Build Status

### Security Audit - COMPLETED

**Date:** 2026-04-03

**Scope:** Dedicated security audit across authentication, authorization, input validation, payment security, Xero security, data exposure, infrastructure, and rate limiting. Build, type check, 292 tests all pass.

**12 issues found and fixed (1 Critical, 2 High, 5 Medium, 4 Low). All fixed:**

1. **CRITICAL: PostgreSQL port exposed to internet** (`docker-compose.yml`) - `ports: "5432:5432"` bound the database to all network interfaces. On a Lightsail instance, this makes the DB reachable from the internet. Combined with `${DB_PASSWORD:-password}` default, an attacker gets full database access. Removed the port mapping entirely — only the app container needs DB access via Docker internal network. (OWASP A05:2021 Security Misconfiguration)

2. **HIGH: App port bypasses Caddy HTTPS** (`docker-compose.yml`) - `ports: "3000:3000"` allowed direct HTTP access to the app, bypassing Caddy's automatic HTTPS, security headers, and certificate validation. Removed the port mapping — Caddy connects to `app:3000` via Docker network. (OWASP A05:2021 Security Misconfiguration)

3. **HIGH: CSP allows unsafe-eval** (`src/middleware.ts`) - `'unsafe-eval'` in `script-src` allowed `eval()`, `Function()`, and similar, significantly weakening XSS protection. Not needed for Next.js production builds. Removed from CSP directive. (OWASP A03:2021 Injection)

4. **MEDIUM: No Stripe webhook idempotency** - No tracking of processed Stripe event IDs. Replayed events could cause duplicate Xero invoices/emails. Added `ProcessedWebhookEvent` model in Prisma schema. Webhook handler now checks for existing event ID before processing and records it after.

5. **MEDIUM: Timing-unsafe cron secret comparison** - `src/app/api/cron/route.ts`, `src/app/api/cron/xero/route.ts`, and `src/app/api/payments/charge-saved-method/route.ts` used `===` for CRON_SECRET comparison. Replaced with `crypto.timingSafeEqual()`.

6. **MEDIUM: Timing-unsafe Xero webhook signature comparison** - `src/app/api/webhooks/xero/route.ts` used `!==` for HMAC comparison. Replaced with `crypto.timingSafeEqual()`.

7. **MEDIUM: Webhook error leaks details** - `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` included Stripe verification error message in response body. Changed to generic "Webhook signature verification failed" message (details still logged server-side).

8. **MEDIUM: Type assertion in reports route** - `src/app/api/admin/reports/route.ts` used `(session.user as { role: string }).role`. Replaced with `session.user.role` consistent with all other routes.

9. **LOW: Password minimum 8 characters** - Increased to 12 per NIST SP 800-63B guidance. Updated server-side Zod schemas in register and reset-password routes, plus client-side validation in both form pages.

10. **LOW: Bcrypt cost factor 12** - Increased to 13 in both register and reset-password routes.

11. **LOW: No audit logging** - Added `AuditLog` model and `logAudit()` fire-and-forget helper. Wired into: booking cancellations (all paths, with refund details), season create/update/delete, promo code create/update/delete, cancellation policy updates.

12. **LOW: JWT 24h expiry** - Reduced from 24 hours to 8 hours to limit token compromise window.

**Security controls verified as working correctly:**
- All 36 API routes check authentication (auth() call)
- All admin routes verify `role === "ADMIN"`
- All inputs validated with Zod schemas
- No raw SQL injection risk (Prisma parameterized, advisory lock uses no user input)
- No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage anywhere
- Stripe webhook signature properly verified with idempotency protection
- Xero OAuth tokens encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM
- Xero webhook HMAC-SHA256 signature verified with timing-safe comparison
- Stripe secret key never exposed client-side
- PaymentIntent amounts set server-side from database
- Booking prices calculated server-side (client cannot manipulate)
- Password reset tokens are single-use with 1-hour expiry
- Rate limiting on all auth routes, booking creation, and query endpoints
- Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, CSP, etc.)
- .env in .gitignore, .env.example contains no real secrets
- Dockerfile uses multi-stage build, runs as non-root user
- No environment variables baked into Docker image

**Files modified:**
- `docker-compose.yml` - Removed exposed PostgreSQL and app ports
- `src/middleware.ts` - Removed `'unsafe-eval'` from CSP script-src
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added ProcessedWebhookEvent and AuditLog models

**New Prisma models (require migration):**
- `ProcessedWebhookEvent` - Tracks processed Stripe/Xero webhook event IDs for idempotency
- `AuditLog` - Records sensitive actions with actor, target, details, timestamp, IP

### Full Integration Review #5 (Remaining Issues) - COMPLETED

**Date:** 2026-04-03

**Scope:** Fix all remaining medium/low issues identified in Review #4 and agent reviews. Build, type check, 292 tests all pass.

**6 issues fixed:**

1. **MEDIUM: Advisory lock only covered check-in date** - Booking creation used a date-derived lock key, so overlapping bookings with different check-in dates bypassed the lock. Changed to a fixed lock key (`pg_advisory_xact_lock(1)`) to serialize all booking creation.

2. **MEDIUM: `(session.user as any).role` type assertions** - 19 occurrences across 9 admin routes used unsafe `as any` cast, despite `session.user.role` being properly typed in `src/types/next-auth.d.ts`. Replaced all with `session.user.role`.

3. **MEDIUM: Missing rate limiting on query endpoints** - `/api/bookings/quote`, `/api/availability`, and `/api/promo-codes/validate` had no rate limiting, enabling abuse. Added `bookingQuery` rate limiter (60 req/min) to all three.

4. **MEDIUM: Non-deterministic chore allocator sorting** - Round-robin tie-breaking returned 0 for equal guests, making assignment order depend on array order. Added stable tie-breaker using `a.id.localeCompare(b.id)`.

5. **MEDIUM: HTML injection in email templates** - User-provided values (firstName, guestName, promoCode, chore names/descriptions) were interpolated directly into HTML without escaping. Added `escapeHtml()` helper and applied it to all user-provided values across all 7 email templates.

6. **LOW: FK indexes already existed** - PasswordResetToken.memberId (`@@index([memberId])`) and ChoreAssignment.choreTemplateId (`@@index([choreTemplateId])`) were already indexed. No change needed.

**Files modified:**
- `src/app/api/bookings/route.ts` - Fixed advisory lock to use fixed key
- `src/app/api/admin/seasons/route.ts` - Removed `as any` cast (2 occurrences)
- `src/app/api/admin/seasons/[id]/route.ts` - Removed `as any` cast (3 occurrences)
- `src/app/api/admin/promo-codes/route.ts` - Removed `as any` cast (2 occurrences)
- `src/app/api/admin/promo-codes/[id]/route.ts` - Removed `as any` cast (3 occurrences)
- `src/app/api/admin/chores/route.ts` - Removed `as any` cast (2 occurrences)
- `src/app/api/admin/chores/[id]/route.ts` - Removed `as any` cast (2 occurrences)
- `src/app/api/admin/cancellation-policy/route.ts` - Removed `as any` cast (2 occurrences)
- `src/app/api/admin/roster/[date]/route.ts` - Removed `as any` cast (2 occurrences)

- `src/app/api/bookings/quote/route.ts` - Added rate limiting
- `src/app/api/availability/route.ts` - Added rate limiting
- `src/app/api/promo-codes/validate/route.ts` - Added rate limiting
- `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` - Added `bookingQuery` rate limiter config
- `src/lib/chore-allocator.ts` - Added stable tie-breaker
- `src/lib/email-templates.ts` - Added `escapeHtml()` and applied to all user values

### Full Integration Review #4 (Complete Codebase) - COMPLETED

**Date:** 2026-04-03

**Scope:** End-to-end flow verification across all 9 phases, concurrency review, data integrity, deployment config. Build, type check, 292 tests all pass.

**6 issues found (3 Critical, 3 High). All fixed:**

1. **CRITICAL: BookingPaymentWrapper not wired into booking flow** - The `BookingPaymentWrapper` component (PaymentForm/SetupForm) existed but was never rendered. Bookings were created without collecting payment (Flow A) or saving a card (Flow B). Added `BookingPaymentSection` client component and integrated it into the booking detail page (`/bookings/[id]`) - shows payment form for CONFIRMED bookings without payment, and SetupForm for PENDING bookings without a saved card.

2. **CRITICAL: Cancellation emails never sent** - `sendBookingCancelledEmail` was defined in `email.ts` but never called from either cancel route. Members received no notification of cancellation or refund. Added email sends to all cancellation paths in both `/api/bookings/cancel` and `/api/bookings/[id]/cancel`.

3. **CRITICAL: Stripe publishable key env var mismatch** - `docker-compose.yml` passed `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` but client code reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`. Stripe would be completely broken in Docker deployment. Fixed env var name in docker-compose and .env.example.

4. **HIGH: Missing env vars in .env.example** - `DB_PASSWORD` and `DOMAIN` used in docker-compose.yml but not documented. Added both to .env.example.

5. **HIGH: Cron double-charge race condition** - `confirmPendingBookings()` and `/api/payments/charge-saved-method` could both charge a pending booking simultaneously. Added atomic `updateMany` claim (WHERE status=PENDING) before charging in both paths, with rollback on failure.

6. **HIGH: Promo code max-redemptions race condition** - Two concurrent bookings could both pass the `currentRedemptions >= maxRedemptions` check and both redeem. Added `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` row lock on the promo code inside the booking transaction.

**Remaining issues (not fixed, documented for future):**
- Duplicate cancel routes (`/api/bookings/cancel` + `/api/bookings/[id]/cancel`) with duplicated logic
- All other medium/low issues from this review have been fixed in Review #5

**Files modified:**
- `src/app/(authenticated)/bookings/[id]/page.tsx` - Added BookingPaymentSection for payment collection
- `src/components/booking-payment-section.tsx` - New client wrapper for BookingPaymentWrapper
- `src/app/api/bookings/cancel/route.ts` - Added sendBookingCancelledEmail calls
- `src/app/api/bookings/[id]/cancel/route.ts` - Added sendBookingCancelledEmail calls
- `docker-compose.yml` - Fixed NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
- `.env.example` - Added DB_PASSWORD, DOMAIN, fixed Stripe key name
- `src/lib/cron-confirm-pending.ts` - Atomic claim before charging, rollback on failure
- `src/app/api/payments/charge-saved-method/route.ts` - Atomic claim before charging
- `src/app/api/bookings/route.ts` - SELECT FOR UPDATE on promo code row
- `src/lib/__tests__/cron-confirm-pending.test.ts` - Added updateMany mock

### Phase 9: Polish & Production Hardening - COMPLETED

**Date:** 2026-04-03

**What was built:**

1. **Error Pages** - Custom 404 (`src/app/not-found.tsx`), 500 error boundary (`src/app/error.tsx`), and global error boundary (`src/app/global-error.tsx`) with user-friendly messages and navigation links.

2. **Security Headers** - New `src/middleware.ts` adds security headers to all responses: `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, and `Content-Security-Policy` (configured for Stripe iframes and inline styles).

3. **Rate Limiting** - In-memory rate limiter (`src/lib/rate-limit.ts`) with automatic cleanup. Applied to:
   - Login: 10 attempts per 15 minutes
   - Register: 5 per hour
   - Forgot password: 5 per hour
   - Reset password: 10 per hour
   - Booking creation: 20 per hour
   - Returns 429 with `Retry-After` header when exceeded

4. **API Route Validation Review** - Fixed across multiple routes:
   - Added Zod discriminated union schema to roster PUT endpoint (`/api/admin/roster/[date]`)
   - Added try-catch error handling to roster PUT and seasons GET
   - Fixed 401/403 status codes in seasons POST (was returning 403 for unauthenticated)
   - Fixed inconsistent "Unauthorised" spelling in profile route
   - All auth routes now have rate limiting

5. **Admin Reports Page** - Full analytics dashboard at `/admin/reports`:
   - Summary cards: total bookings, revenue, guests, avg occupancy
   - Occupancy rate area chart (daily, with downsampling for large ranges)
   - Revenue by month bar chart
   - Booking trends line chart (weekly: total, confirmed, cancelled)
   - Member vs non-member pie chart
   - Booking status breakdown pie chart
   - Configurable date range picker
   - API: `/api/admin/reports?from=YYYY-MM-DD&to=YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Uses recharts for all visualizations

6. **Email Template Polish** - All email templates converted from inline HTML to structured, branded templates (`src/lib/email-templates.ts`):
   - Consistent TAC branding header with mountain icon
   - Responsive table layout (600px max-width)
   - Styled CTAs (buttons), info tables, alert boxes
   - Templates: welcome, password reset, booking confirmed, booking pending, booking bumped, booking cancelled, chore roster
   - Added `sendBookingCancelledEmail` function

7. **Automated Database Backup** - Cron-based pg_dump backup system (`src/lib/backup.ts`):
   - Runs daily at 3 AM (configurable via `BACKUP_CRON_SCHEDULE` env var)
   - Gzip compression, stored in `/tmp/tacbookings-backups/`
   - Optional S3 upload (configurable via `BACKUP_S3_BUCKET`)
   - Automatic cleanup of old backups (configurable retention days)

- `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` - Days to keep local backups (default: 7)
- `BACKUP_CRON_SCHEDULE` - Cron expression for backup timing (default: 0 3 * * *)

**Promo code integration verified:**
- Stripe charges `finalPriceCents` (after discount) in all payment flows
- Xero invoices include discount as negative line item when `discountCents > 0`
- Booking confirmation emails show subtotal/discount/total when a promo code was applied

**How to run:**
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npx prisma generate
npm test              # 292 tests pass (14 test files)
npm run build         # builds successfully
```

### Cross-Phase Integration Review #3 (Wave 2 Merge) - COMPLETED

**Date:** 2026-04-03

**Scope:** Focused review of Phases 7 (Promo Codes) and 9 (Polish & Production Hardening) integration with the rest of the codebase after Wave 2 merge. Build, type check, 292 tests all pass.

**5 issues found (2 Critical, 3 High). All fixed:**

1. **CRITICAL: Promo redemption not cleaned up on bumping** - `bumpPendingBookings()` in `bumping.ts` set booking status to BUMPED but never deleted the PromoRedemption record or decremented `currentRedemptions` on PromoCode. This inflated the usage counter, preventing valid future redemptions. Added cleanup within the existing transaction.

2. **CRITICAL: Promo redemption not cleaned up on cancellation** - Both `/api/bookings/cancel` and `/api/bookings/[id]/cancel` cancelled bookings without cleaning up PromoRedemption records. The promo code usage counter remained inflated. Added `cleanupPromoRedemption()` helper to both routes, called on all cancellation paths (PENDING, CONFIRMED with no payment, CONFIRMED with refund, CONFIRMED with no refund).

3. **HIGH: Login route not rate limited** - `rateLimiters.login` was defined (10 attempts per 15 minutes) but never applied. The `[...nextauth]/route.ts` directly re-exported NextAuth handlers. Wrapped the POST handler with `applyRateLimit(rateLimiters.login, request)` before delegating to NextAuth.

4. **HIGH: Promo code PUT route missing type-specific validation** - Admin promo code update endpoint (`/api/admin/promo-codes/[id]`) accepted updates without validating type-specific fields. Could set `percentOff: 0` on a PERCENTAGE code, creating a useless discount. Added validation matching the POST route, using effective values (new value or existing) for the resolved type.

5. **HIGH: Promo code expiry boundary off-by-one** - `validatePromoCodeRules()` in `promo.ts` used `now > validUntil` (strictly greater), allowing redemption at the exact expiry timestamp. Changed to `now >= validUntil` for correct exclusive upper bound.

**Remaining Medium/Low issues (not fixed, documented for future):**
- `rateLimiters.login` defined but cron auth patterns still inconsistent (`x-cron-secret` vs `Authorization: Bearer`)
- `cron-confirm-pending.ts` line 115 overwrites `payment.amountCents` with Stripe's `paymentIntent.amount` (should always match `finalPriceCents`, but fragile)
- 14 admin routes still use `(session.user as any).role` instead of `session.user.role`
- Duplicate cancel routes (`/api/bookings/cancel` + `/api/bookings/[id]/cancel`) with duplicated promo cleanup logic
- Missing test for exact `validUntil` boundary in promo tests

**Files modified:**
- `src/lib/bumping.ts` - Added PromoRedemption cleanup in bump loop
- `src/lib/__tests__/bumping.test.ts` - Added promoRedemption/promoCode mocks to txMock objects
- `src/app/api/bookings/cancel/route.ts` - Added cleanupPromoRedemption helper and calls
- `src/app/api/bookings/[id]/cancel/route.ts` - Added cleanupPromoRedemption helper and calls
- `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - Wrapped POST with login rate limiter
- `src/app/api/admin/promo-codes/[id]/route.ts` - Added type-specific field validation to PUT
- `src/lib/promo.ts` - Fixed validUntil boundary from `>` to `>=`

### Cross-Phase Integration Review #2 - COMPLETED

**Date:** 2026-04-03

**Scope:** Full 8-section codebase review after all phases merged. Build, type check, 224 tests all pass. Reviewed: build/types, dependencies, cross-phase integration, Prisma schema, auth/security, business logic, error handling, code quality.

**15 issues found (1 Critical, 2 High, 8 Medium, 4 Low). All Critical and High issues fixed:**

1. **CRITICAL: Xero invoice night calculation wrong** - `createXeroInvoiceForBooking()` in `xero.ts` used `Math.round()` on millisecond diff to calculate nights, which could produce incorrect counts (rounding errors from timezone offsets). Replaced with `getStayNights()` from pricing engine for consistency.
2. **HIGH: Xero token refresh unhandled** - `getAuthenticatedXeroClient()` called `xero.refreshWithRefreshToken()` with no try-catch. If Xero is unreachable or refresh token is invalid, the error propagated unhandled. Added try-catch with descriptive error message.
3. **HIGH: Season end boundary bug in membership check** - `findSubscriptionInvoice()` used `invoiceDate > seasonEnd` where `seasonEnd` was March 31 at midnight. Invoices dated March 31 with a time component would be incorrectly rejected. Changed to exclusive upper bound using April 1 (`invoiceDate >= seasonEndExclusive`).

**Remaining Medium/Low issues (not fixed, documented for future):**
- Missing FK indexes on `PasswordResetToken.memberId` and `ChoreAssignment.choreTemplateId`
- `getSeasonYear` duplicated in 3 files (`utils.ts`, `pricing.ts`, `age-tier.ts`)
- `formatCents` duplicated in 2 files
- Inconsistent cron auth patterns (`x-cron-secret` vs `Authorization: Bearer`)
- 14 admin routes use `(session.user as any).role` instead of `session.user.role`
- Duplicate cancel routes (`/api/bookings/cancel` + `/api/bookings/[id]/cancel`) with different patterns
- `/api/admin/roster/[date]` PUT endpoint missing Zod input validation
- `/api/seasons` GET and `/api/availability` have no auth (may be intentionally public)
- Unused `Room` model in Prisma schema
- Unused `calculateRefund` function in `pricing.ts` (active version is in `cancellation.ts`)
- `dotenv` package required by `prisma.config.ts` (added as devDependency)

### Cross-Phase Integration Review #1 - COMPLETED

**Date:** 2026-04-03

**Scope:** Full codebase review after merging Phases 5, 6, and 8 in parallel. Build, type check, 224 tests all pass. Reviewed cross-phase integration, auth/security, Prisma schema, business logic, error handling, dependencies, and code quality.

**24 issues found (2 Critical, 8 High, 10 Medium, 4 Low). All Critical and High issues fixed:**

1. **CRITICAL: `/api/bookings/cancel` had no auth** - Auth and ownership checks were commented out with TODO. Restored `auth()` call and `memberId` ownership verification.
2. **HIGH: Payment routes missing ownership checks** - `/api/payments/create-payment-intent` and `/api/payments/create-setup-intent` verified auth but not booking ownership. Added `booking.memberId !== session.user.id` checks.
3. **HIGH: Missing Xero invoice on manual charge** - `/api/payments/charge-saved-method` confirmed bookings without creating Xero invoices. Added guarded `createXeroInvoiceForBooking()` call.
4. **HIGH: Duplicate cancellation routes with inconsistent logic** - `/api/bookings/[id]/cancel` just set status without refund/Xero. Rewrote to include full cancellation flow (policy-based refund, Stripe refund, Xero credit note).
5. **HIGH: Wrong CHILD age threshold in profile** - `/api/profile` had local `computeAgeTier` using `age < 10` instead of canonical `age < 13`. Now imports from `@/lib/age-tier`.
6. **HIGH: Missing Xero env vars in docker-compose** - `XERO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `XERO_WEBHOOK_KEY` not passed to app container. Added both. Also added `DOMAIN` env var for Caddy.
7. **HIGH: No cron overlap guard** - Both cron jobs in `instrumentation.ts` could run concurrently if a previous execution hadn't finished. Added `isRunning` flags with `finally` cleanup.

### Phase 6: Xero Integration - COMPLETED

**Date:** 2026-04-03

**What was built:**
- **OAuth2 flow:** Admin "Connect Xero" button redirects to Xero authorization, callback stores encrypted tokens
- **Token management:** AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest, auto-refresh 5 minutes before 30-min expiry
- **Invoice creation:** `createXeroInvoiceForBooking(bookingId)` - creates Xero invoice with per-guest line items, records payment against invoice, stores `xeroInvoiceId` on Payment record
- **Credit notes:** `createXeroCreditNote(paymentId, refundAmountCents)` - creates credit note against original invoice for refunds
- **Contact sync:** Bulk import from Xero (matches by email), find-or-create on invoice creation, links `xeroContactId` on Member
- **Membership verification:** `checkMembershipStatus(memberId)` - queries Xero invoices for subscription keywords in current season year, updates MemberSubscription status (PAID/UNPAID/OVERDUE)
- **Daily cron:** `POST /api/cron/xero` (secured with CRON_SECRET) refreshes membership status for all active members with Xero contacts
- **Xero webhook handler:** HMAC-SHA256 signature verification, intent-to-receive pattern support
- **Admin page:** `/admin/xero` - connection status, connect/disconnect, contact sync, membership refresh with results display
- **Tests:** 36 new tests covering encryption, invoice line items, subscription matching, season year boundaries

**Key files:**
- `src/lib/xero.ts` - Core Xero integration library (all business logic)
- `src/lib/__tests__/xero.test.ts` - 36 tests
- `src/app/(admin)/admin/xero/page.tsx` - Admin Xero status page
- `src/app/api/admin/xero/connect/route.ts` - OAuth2 redirect
- `src/app/api/admin/xero/callback/route.ts` - OAuth2 callback
- `src/app/api/admin/xero/disconnect/route.ts` - Disconnect
- `src/app/api/admin/xero/status/route.ts` - Connection status
- `src/app/api/admin/xero/sync-contacts/route.ts` - Bulk contact import
- `src/app/api/admin/xero/sync-memberships/route.ts` - Membership refresh
- `src/app/api/webhooks/xero/route.ts` - Webhook handler
- `src/app/api/cron/xero/route.ts` - Daily cron endpoint

**Integration points (for other phases to wire in):**
- Call `createXeroInvoiceForBooking(bookingId)` after booking confirmation + payment success
- Call `createXeroCreditNote(paymentId, refundAmountCents)` after Stripe refund processing
- Call `checkMembershipStatus(memberId)` on login to verify current subscription

**Environment variables required:**
- `XERO_CLIENT_ID` - From Xero developer app
- `XERO_CLIENT_SECRET` - From Xero developer app
- `XERO_REDIRECT_URI` - OAuth2 callback URL
- `XERO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` - 64-char hex string for token encryption (generate: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`)
- `XERO_WEBHOOK_KEY` - From Xero webhook subscription config

5. **Phase 8: Chore Roster** - ChoreTemplate schema extended (recommendedPeopleMin/Max, isEssential, ageRestriction enum, conditionalNote), 17 chore templates seeded, auto-suggest allocation algorithm with round-robin/age restrictions/4-day history lookback/occupancy scaling, admin chores CRUD (`/admin/chores`), admin roster review (`/admin/roster`) with date picker/reassignment/confirm, printable A4 roster (`/admin/roster/[date]/print`), roster email to guests, 39 chore allocator tests

**How to run:**
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npx prisma generate
npm test              # 268+ tests pass (13+ test files)
npm run build         # builds successfully
```

**To seed database (requires running PostgreSQL):**
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name initial
npm run db:seed
```

**Test accounts (from seed):**
- Admin: admin@tac.org.nz / admin123
- Member: member@tac.org.nz / member123

**Known considerations:**
- nodemailer v8 has peer dep conflict with next-auth (use `--legacy-peer-deps`)
- Prisma v6 (not v7) - standard PostgreSQL compatible
- All prices stored as integer cents
- Season year: April-March cycle
- No migrations committed yet - run `prisma migrate dev` to create initial migration from merged schema
- Xero account codes default to "200" (sales) and "090" (bank) - may need configuration for specific Xero orgs

### Phase 5 Details: Non-Member Guests & Bumping

**Key files:**
- `src/lib/bumping.ts` - FIFO bumping algorithm: finds PENDING non-member bookings overlapping date range, bumps most-recent-first until capacity restored
- `src/lib/cron-confirm-pending.ts` - Cron processing: finds PENDING bookings past hold deadline, checks capacity, charges saved PaymentMethod or bumps
- `src/instrumentation.ts` - Next.js instrumentation hook: schedules node-cron job every 3 hours
- `src/app/api/cron/route.ts` - Manual cron trigger endpoint (secured by CRON_SECRET header)
- `src/app/api/bookings/route.ts` - Updated to integrate bumping when member bookings exceed capacity

**Booking flow logic:**
- **All-member guests OR check-in <= 7 days**: status = CONFIRMED, collect Stripe payment immediately
- **Has non-member guests AND check-in > 7 days**: status = PENDING, collect card via SetupIntent, set `nonMemberHoldUntil = checkIn - 7 days`
- **Member booking exceeds capacity**: triggers FIFO bumping of PENDING bookings (most recent first)
- **Non-member booking exceeds capacity**: rejected (cannot bump other bookings)

**Cron job behavior (every 3 hours):**
1. Finds PENDING bookings where `nonMemberHoldUntil <= now()`
2. For each: re-checks bed availability
3. If beds available + payment method saved: charges card, confirms booking, sends email
4. If beds not available: bumps booking, sends notification email
5. Continues processing remaining bookings even if one fails

**Edge cases handled:**
- Stops bumping as soon as capacity is restored (doesn't over-bump)
- Returns capacityRestored=false if bumping all PENDING bookings isn't enough
- Booking API rejects new booking if capacity can't be restored
- Cron handles missing payment methods gracefully (marks as failed)
- Cron handles Stripe charge failures gracefully
- Bumped notification emails sent after transaction commits (no emails on rollback)
- Advisory locks prevent concurrent double-booking

### Phase 7: Promo Codes & Discounts - COMPLETED

**Date:** 2026-04-03

**What was built:**
- **Admin CRUD:** Full create/edit/delete/toggle-active for promo codes at `/admin/promo-codes` with redemption count display
- **Promo validation library:** `src/lib/promo.ts` with `validatePromoCodeRules()` (pure logic), `validatePromoCodeFull()` (with DB lookups), `redeemPromoCode()` (transactional redemption)
- **Validation API:** `POST /api/promo-codes/validate` - validates code and returns discount preview for booking details
- **Booking wizard integration:** `PromoCodeInput` component (`src/components/promo-code-input.tsx`) with apply/remove, discount preview in price summary
- **Booking API integration:** `POST /api/bookings` accepts optional `promoCode`, validates within transaction, creates `PromoRedemption` record, increments `currentRedemptions`
- **Booking detail display:** Shows promo code name and discount amount on booking detail page
- **Discount types:** PERCENTAGE (% off total), FIXED_AMOUNT ($ off, capped at total), FREE_NIGHTS (cheapest N nights free)
- **Validation rules:** Code exists, active, within date range, not expired, max redemptions not reached, single-use per member, members-only flag
- **Tests:** 44 new tests covering all validation rules, all discount type calculations, edge cases (discount exceeds total, zero-value codes, single-night FREE_NIGHTS)

**Key files:**
- `src/lib/promo.ts` - Promo validation and redemption logic
- `src/lib/__tests__/promo.test.ts` - 44 tests
- `src/app/(admin)/admin/promo-codes/page.tsx` - Admin promo codes page
- `src/app/api/admin/promo-codes/route.ts` - Admin CRUD (list + create)
- `src/app/api/admin/promo-codes/[id]/route.ts` - Admin CRUD (get, update, delete)
- `src/app/api/promo-codes/validate/route.ts` - Promo code validation endpoint
- `src/components/promo-code-input.tsx` - Booking wizard promo code component

**Modified files:**
- `src/app/api/bookings/route.ts` - Added promo code validation and redemption in booking creation
- `src/app/(authenticated)/book/page.tsx` - Added PromoCodeInput component and discount display
- `src/app/(authenticated)/bookings/[id]/page.tsx` - Shows promo code in discount line

### Remaining Post-Build Tasks
- GitHub Actions deploy pipeline
- Member data import from Checkfront/Xero
- User acceptance testing with club committee

## Context

Tokoroa Alpine Club (TAC) is a not-for-profit operating a 29-bed alpine lodge. They currently use Checkfront for booking management and Xero for accounting/membership. They want to replace Checkfront with a bespoke booking and membership system that integrates deeply with Xero and Stripe. The club has ~410 members (310 adult, 60 youth, 40 child), no developers on the team - building entirely with LLM assistance. Hosted on AWS Lightsail.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Framework** | Next.js 15 (App Router) | Full-stack TypeScript monolith. Largest LLM training corpus. Single codebase for frontend + API |
| **Language** | TypeScript | Type safety catches errors at compile time. LLMs generate excellent TS |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 16 | Robust relational DB, handles bookings/members/payments well. Free on Lightsail |
| **ORM** | Prisma | Type-safe DB access, declarative schema = self-documenting, auto migrations |
| **Auth** | NextAuth.js v5 (Auth.js) | Credentials provider (email+password), JWT sessions, built-in password reset |
| **UI** | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui | Production-quality components without design skills. LLMs produce excellent Tailwind |
| **Payments** | Stripe (PaymentIntents + SetupIntents) | Industry standard, Xero has native Stripe feed |
| **Accounting** | Xero API via `xero-node` SDK | Full bidirectional sync: invoices, contacts, payments |
| **Email** | AWS SES via `nodemailer` (or Resend) | Already on AWS. Transactional emails for confirmations, resets, notifications |
| **Deployment** | Docker Compose on Lightsail | Single `docker compose up` deploys everything |
| **Reverse Proxy** | Caddy 2 | Automatic HTTPS via Let's Encrypt. Two-line config |
| **Scheduled Jobs** | `node-cron` in Next.js `instrumentation.ts` | No external scheduler needed for this scale |

**Why NOT alternatives:**
- Django/Rails: Two-language problem (Python/Ruby + JS for frontend)
- Microservices: Massively over-engineered for 410 users
- Separate React SPA + Express: Two codebases instead of one
- Supabase/Firebase: Adds vendor lock-in, another abstraction layer

## Architecture Overview

```
Internet
    |
    v
[Caddy - auto HTTPS, ports 80/443]
    |
    v
[Next.js App - port 3000]
    |
    v
[PostgreSQL 16 - port 5432]

External Services:
  - Stripe (payments + webhooks)
  - Xero (accounting + webhooks)
  - AWS SES (transactional email)
```

All three services run via Docker Compose on a single Lightsail instance ($10-20/mo, 2GB RAM).

### Key Relationships
- Member -> many Bookings, many MemberSubscriptions, many PromoRedemptions
- Booking -> many BookingGuests, one Payment, many ChoreAssignments
- Season -> many SeasonRates
- ChoreTemplate -> many ChoreAssignments

## Core Business Logic

### 1. Booking Flow
1. Member selects dates on availability calendar
2. System shows available beds (29 minus confirmed guests per night in range)
3. Member adds themselves + guests (name, age tier, member/non-member)
4. System calculates price: look up SeasonRate for each guest's ageTier + isMember for each night
5. Member optionally applies promo code
6. **If all guests are members OR checkIn <= 7 days away**: status = CONFIRMED, collect Stripe payment immediately
7. **If any guest is non-member AND checkIn > 7 days away**: status = PENDING, collect card details via Stripe SetupIntent (no charge yet), set `nonMemberHoldUntil = checkIn - 7 days`

### 2. Non-Member Priority Bumping (FIFO - last booked = first bumped)
When a member creates a booking that would fill the lodge past 29 beds on any night:
1. Find all PENDING bookings overlapping those nights
2. Sort by `createdAt DESC` (most recent first)
3. Bump bookings one at a time until capacity is restored
4. For each bumped booking: set status = BUMPED, send notification email
5. No refund needed (payment wasn't taken for PENDING bookings)

### 3. Pending Booking Confirmation (Cron - runs every few hours)
1. Find PENDING bookings where `nonMemberHoldUntil <= now()`
2. Re-check availability for each
3. If beds available: charge saved PaymentMethod via Stripe, set CONFIRMED, create Xero invoice, email confirmation
4. If beds no longer available: set BUMPED, email notification

### 4. Pricing Engine
- For each night in stay: determine which Season it falls in, look up SeasonRate for guest's ageTier + isMember
- All prices stored as integer cents (e.g. $45.50 = 4550)
- Promo code application: FREE_NIGHTS (subtract cheapest N nights), PERCENTAGE (% off total), FIXED_AMOUNT (flat $ off)

### 5. Cancellation & Refunds
- Admin-configurable policy: e.g. 14+ days = 100% refund, 7-14 days = 50%, <7 days = 0%
- Members cancel from their booking detail page
- System calculates refund based on policy, processes Stripe refund, creates Xero credit note

### 6. Chore Roster
- Admin configures chore templates (name, recommended people count, min age)
- For a given date, system auto-suggests assignments using round-robin across all confirmed guests
- Hut leader reviews on admin panel, can reassign/edit
- Confirms roster - status changes from SUGGESTED to CONFIRMED
- Printable A4 page: clean table with guest names, assigned chores, date - CSS `@media print` styling

### 7. Xero Integration (Full Bidirectional Sync)

**OAuth2 Flow:**
1. Admin clicks "Connect Xero" in admin panel
2. Redirects to Xero authorization
3. Callback stores encrypted access + refresh tokens
4. Auto-refresh before 30-min expiry

**Xero -> TAC (Membership Verification):**
- Daily cron + on-login check: query Xero for member's contact by `xeroContactId`
- Check for paid invoices matching current season subscription
- Update MemberSubscription status
- Season year logic: if current month >= April, seasonYear = currentYear; else seasonYear = currentYear - 1

**TAC -> Xero (Booking Invoices):**
- On CONFIRMED + payment succeeded:
  1. Find or create Xero Contact for the member
  2. Create Xero Invoice with line items (per guest, per night, showing rates)
  3. Record payment against the invoice
  4. Store xeroInvoiceId on Payment record

**Refund Sync:**
- Stripe refund webhook -> create Xero credit note against original invoice

## Email Notifications

| Event | Recipient | Content |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Registration | New member | Welcome email |
| Password reset | Member | Reset link (1hr expiry) |
| Booking confirmed | Booking member | Dates, guests, total, payment receipt |
| Booking pending | Booking member | Dates, guests, explanation of hold period |
| Pending -> confirmed | Booking member | Payment taken, confirmation details |
| Booking bumped | Booking member | Apology, explanation, rebooking link |
| Booking cancelled | Booking member | Cancellation confirmation, refund amount |
| Chore roster | All guests for date | Their assigned chores for the day |
| Admin: new booking | Admin | Notification of new booking |
| Admin: capacity warning | Admin | Lodge nearly full for upcoming dates |
| Admin: pending approaching deadline | Admin | Non-member bookings about to auto-confirm |

## Key Design Decisions

- **All prices in cents as integers** - prevents floating point rounding bugs with money
- **Timezone: Pacific/Auckland (NZST/NZDT)** - all dates stored as date-only (no time) since bookings are per-night. Server timezone set to NZ
- **JWT sessions (not database sessions)** - 410 members, simple roles. 24hr expiry with refresh. Trade-off: can't instantly revoke, but acceptable at this scale
- **Capacity-based booking (not room-based)** - members book beds, admin assigns rooms separately if needed. Simplifies the booking engine significantly
- **Season year = April to March** - if current month >= April, seasonYear = currentYear; else seasonYear = currentYear - 1

## Verification & Testing

- **Unit tests**: Pricing engine, availability calculator, bumping algorithm, chore allocator (use Vitest)
- **Integration tests**: Booking flow end-to-end, Stripe webhook handling, Xero sync
- **Manual testing**: Each phase deployed and tested on Lightsail before proceeding
- **UAT**: Club committee tests before go-live with real member data
- **Stripe test mode**: Use Stripe test keys throughout development, switch to live keys at go-live
- **Xero demo company**: Test against Xero demo org before connecting production

## Development Workflow: How to Build This with Claude

### Overview

The build uses a **session-per-phase** approach. Each session focuses on one build phase, runs autonomously with minimal interruption, and hands off cleanly to the next session via CLAUDE.md. Within each session, Claude uses sub-agents in parallel where modules are independent.

### Step 1: Configure Claude Code for Autonomous Work

Create `.claude/settings.json` in the project root to pre-approve safe commands so Claude doesn't ask permission for every npm/git/prisma operation:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(npm *)",
      "Bash(npx *)",
      "Bash(node *)",
      "Bash(git add *)",
      "Bash(git commit *)",
      "Bash(git push *)",
      "Bash(git status*)",
      "Bash(git diff*)",
      "Bash(git log*)",
      "Bash(docker compose *)",
      "Bash(mkdir *)",
      "Bash(ls *)",
      "Bash(cat *)",
      "Bash(cp *)",
      "Bash(mv *)",
      "Bash(rm -rf node_modules)",
      "Bash(rm -rf .next)",
      "Read(*)",
      "Edit(*)",
      "Write(*)",
      "Glob(*)",
      "Grep(*)"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Bash(rm -rf /)*",
      "Bash(rm -rf .git)*"
    ]
  }
}
```

This eliminates ~90% of permission prompts. Claude can freely create files, install packages, run builds/tests, commit, and push without stopping to ask.

### Step 2: Structure CLAUDE.md for Session Handoff

The CLAUDE.md in the repo root is the **single source of truth** that any new Claude session reads first. It must always contain:

1. **What the project is** (context, requirements) - already written
2. **What has been built so far** - updated at end of each session
3. **What to build next** - the next phase's scope
4. **How to run/test it** - commands that work right now
5. **Known issues / decisions made** - so Claude doesn't re-litigate settled decisions

At the end of each build session, tell Claude: **"Update CLAUDE.md with what was built, what works, and what's next. Commit and push."**

### Step 3: Add Path-Scoped Rules for Focused Context

Create `.claude/rules/` directory with files that only load when Claude touches files in matching paths:

**`.claude/rules/database.md`** (loads when touching `prisma/**`):
```
- All prices stored as integer cents (e.g. $45.50 = 4550)
- Use Prisma transactions for any multi-table writes
- Always add indexes on foreign keys and commonly queried fields
- Season year: if month >= April, year = currentYear; else year = currentYear - 1
```

**`.claude/rules/api.md`** (loads when touching `src/app/api/**`):
```
- Validate all inputs with Zod schemas
- Return consistent error shape: { error: string, details?: any }
- Always check auth via auth() helper before processing
- Admin routes must verify role === ADMIN
```

**`.claude/rules/stripe.md`** (loads when touching `src/lib/stripe*`):
```
- Always verify Stripe webhook signatures
- Use PaymentIntents for confirmed bookings, SetupIntents for pending
- Store all Stripe IDs for reconciliation
- Handle idempotency - webhooks may fire multiple times
```

**`.claude/rules/testing.md`** (loads when touching `**/*.test.*`):
```
- Use Vitest for all tests
- Test business logic (pricing, availability, bumping) thoroughly
- Mock Stripe and Xero API calls in tests
- Every new lib/ function should have tests before the session ends
```

### Step 4: Session-per-Phase Execution

Each phase = one Claude Code session. Here's how to run each:

**Starting a session (your prompt to Claude):**
```
Read CLAUDE.md. Build Phase [N]: [Phase Name].

Build everything in this phase autonomously. Write tests for all
business logic. Commit after each major milestone. When done, update
CLAUDE.md with what was built, commands to run/test, and what's next.
Push all commits.
```

That's it. Claude reads the plan, knows the full context, builds the phase, tests it, commits, and updates the handoff doc. You review the output at the end.

**What Claude does autonomously within a session:**
- Reads CLAUDE.md and the phase requirements
- Creates files, installs dependencies
- Writes implementation code
- Writes tests and runs them
- Fixes failing tests
- Commits at milestones (e.g. "Add Prisma schema and seed", "Add auth with NextAuth")
- Updates CLAUDE.md at the end
- Pushes to the branch

**When Claude SHOULD interrupt you:**
- Ambiguous requirements (e.g. "should promo codes stack?")
- Architecture decisions not covered in the plan
- External service setup needed (e.g. "I need your Stripe test API key")
- A persistent bug it can't resolve after 2-3 attempts

### Step 5: Security & Quality Checkpoints

After each phase is built, run a dedicated **review session** before moving to the next phase:

```
Read CLAUDE.md. Review Phase [N] code for:
1. Security vulnerabilities (OWASP top 10, input validation, auth bypass)
2. Business logic correctness (edge cases in pricing, bumping, availability)
3. Error handling (what happens when Stripe/Xero is down?)
4. Test coverage gaps
5. Code quality (duplication, unnecessary complexity)

Fix any issues found. Do NOT add features or refactor beyond what's needed.
Commit fixes and push.
```

### Step 6: Parallel Sub-Agents Within Sessions

Claude automatically uses sub-agents for independent work within a session. For example, during Phase 3 (Core Booking), Claude might:
- **Agent 1**: Build the availability calculator + tests
- **Agent 2**: Build the booking calendar UI component
- **Agent 3**: Research the best date-range picker library for the stack

These run in parallel, then Claude integrates the results. You don't need to orchestrate this - Claude decides when parallelism helps.

### Recommended Session Sequence

| Session | Phase | Prompt | Duration |
|---------|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Foundation | "Build Phase 1: Foundation" | ~30-45 min |
| 1R | Review | "Review Phase 1 for security and correctness" | ~15 min |
| 2 | Seasons & Pricing | "Build Phase 2: Seasons & Pricing" | ~20 min |
| 3 | Core Booking | "Build Phase 3: Core Booking" | ~45 min |
| 3R | Review | "Review Phases 2-3 for security and correctness" | ~15 min |
| 4 | Payments | "Build Phase 4: Stripe Payments" | ~30 min |
| 4R | Review | "Review Phase 4 - payment security is critical" | ~15 min |
| 5 | Non-Member + Bumping | "Build Phase 5: Non-Member Guests & Bumping" | ~30 min |
| 5R | Review | "Review Phase 5 bumping logic edge cases" | ~15 min |
| 6 | Xero Integration | "Build Phase 6: Xero Integration" | ~30 min |
| 7 | Promo Codes | "Build Phase 7: Promo Codes & Discounts" | ~20 min |
| 8 | Chore Roster | "Build Phase 8: Chore Roster" | ~30 min |
| 8R | Review | "Full security and integration review of all phases" | ~20 min |
| 9 | Polish | "Build Phase 9: Polish & Production Hardening" | ~30 min |

**Total: ~15 sessions, mostly hands-off.** You review output between sessions and provide any missing info (API keys, domain name, etc).

### What You Need to Provide (Once, Before Starting)

Before Phase 1, gather these. Claude will ask for them when needed but having them ready avoids interruptions:

1. **Domain name** for the booking system
2. **Stripe account** - sign up at stripe.com, get test API keys from dashboard
3. **Xero app** - register at developer.xero.com, get client ID and secret
4. **AWS SES** - verify your sending domain in SES console (or use Resend as alternative - simpler setup)
5. **Lightsail instance** - provision a 2GB Ubuntu 24.04 instance, attach a static IP, note the IP address
6. **Club logo** (optional) - PNG/SVG for the booking site header

### Recovery: When Things Go Wrong

If a session produces broken code:
```
Read CLAUDE.md. The last session left the build in a broken state.
Run `npm run build` and `npm test` to see what's failing.
Fix all errors without changing working functionality.
Commit and push when green.
```

If you want to restart a phase from scratch:
```
Read CLAUDE.md. Revert Phase [N] commits and rebuild Phase [N]
from the beginning using a different approach for [specific issue].
```

### Hooks for Auto-Formatting (Optional)

Add to `.claude/settings.json` to auto-format code after every edit:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "npx prettier --write \"$CLAUDE_FILE_PATH\" 2>/dev/null || true"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "npx prettier --write \"$CLAUDE_FILE_PATH\" 2>/dev/null || true"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
