# Email Message Registry

This is the registry of outbound email messages in the current repository state.
The main senders live under `src/lib/email/` (with `src/lib/email.ts` kept as a
re-export facade); the core `sendEmail` transport is in `src/lib/email/core.ts`
and most HTML bodies are in
`src/lib/email-templates.ts`. Direct one-off senders also exist in the contact
route, refund appeal admin route, admin bulk communications route, and email
retry cron.

This audit covers mail sent by this repository through its Nodemailer/SES path.
I did not find a repo path that instructs Xero to email invoices; any Xero-side
invoice email would be outside this repo's sender inventory.

The `/admin/setup` hub links to `/admin/notifications`, where administrators
can edit shared email variables and template wording without changing
TypeScript files. Admin/system notification delivery policies are managed from
`/admin/notifications`.

Sensitive tokens (`{{doorCode}}`, `{{token}}`, `{{pin}}`, `{{resetUrl}}`,
`{{verifyUrl}}`, `{{confirmationUrl}}`) are body-only: subjects are persisted
in `EmailLog` for every template and travel in clear mail headers, so template
override subjects containing these tokens are rejected at save time, and the
renderer never substitutes their values into a subject line. Required tokens
must appear in the template body; a token in the subject does not satisfy the
requirement.

## Runtime Placeholders

The public checkout has no `config/club.json`, so the checked-in fallback values
come from `config/club.example.json`.

- `{{CLUB_NAME}}`: `Example Mountain Club` in this checkout.
- `{{CLUB_BOOKINGS_NAME}}`: `Example Mountain Club - Bookings` in this checkout.
- `{{CLUB_LODGE_NAME}}`: `Example Mountain Club Lodge` in this checkout.
- `{{CLUB_EMAIL_FROM_NAME}}`: `Example Mountain Club - Online Booking System`
  in this checkout.
- `{{SUPPORT_EMAIL}}`: `support@example.org` in this checkout unless overridden
  by `SUPPORT_EMAIL`.
- `{{CONTACT_EMAIL}}`: `bookings@example.org` in this checkout unless overridden
  by `CONTACT_EMAIL`.
- `{{BASE_URL}}`: `NEXTAUTH_URL` origin at runtime, or `http://localhost:3000`.
- `{{CLUB_LODGE_TRAVEL_NOTE}}`: `The lodge is located near the mountain. Please allow adequate travel time.`

## Common Email Frame

All messages built with `layout()` have this visible frame around the body:

```text
{{CLUB_EMAIL_FROM_NAME}}

Online Booking System

...message body...

{{CLUB_NAME}} • Online Booking System
{{BASE_URL without protocol}}
```

The contact form and permanent email-failure alert do not use this branded
frame.

Admin alert emails are sent once per active admin whose admin notification
preference allows that alert type. They are sent as separate emails, not one
BCC. SES bounce/complaint suppression can skip a recipient before SMTP send.

Member notification preferences (`NotificationPreference`, managed from the
profile page) split into two groups by design (#1285):

- **Must-send transactional (always sent, not toggleable):** booking
  confirmation/pending (`bookingConfirmation`), pending-booking bumps
  (`bookingBumped`), and cancellation/refund notices (`bookingCancelled`). These
  are essential updates about a booking the member owns, so the send path never
  gates them. The profile UI lists them as informational "Always sent" rows with
  no on/off switch — a switch there would promise control that is never honored
  and could hide a cancellation or refund from the person affected.
- **Optional (honored before the send path):** check-in reminders
  (`bookingReminder`, gated in `cron-checkin-reminders.ts` via `shouldSendEmail`)
  and chore rosters (`choreRoster`, gated in `admin-roster-service.ts` via
  `shouldSendChoreRoster`, before the chore token is created). A member who
  switches either off does not receive that mail. For chore rosters the
  preference is resolved with an **Option C hybrid** (#1285): the guest's own
  `NotificationPreference` row wins when it exists; otherwise, if the guest
  inherits their email from a primary member (`inheritEmailFromId`), the
  primary's preference governs (the roster lands in the primary's inbox, so a
  dependent follows the parent's opt-out); if neither has a row — including a
  non-member guest with no member record — the roster is sent (documented
  "no preference → send"). Club Communications (`marketingEmails`) is honored
  separately by the bulk-send recipient filter.

`shouldSendEmail` (`src/lib/email/core.ts`) is the canonical gate for the
optional member categories, with `shouldSendChoreRoster` (same file) layering
the dependent/inheritance resolution on top for chore rosters; neither is ever
applied to the must-send transactional senders.

Failed non-sensitive emails with retained HTML are retried every 30 minutes,
with a 15 minute backoff and at most 3 attempts. Token-bearing templates are not
auto-retried because their HTML is deliberately not retained.

## Exact Messages

### password-reset

Subject:

```text
Reset your {{CLUB_NAME}} password
```

Body:

```text
Password Reset

You requested a password reset for your {{CLUB_NAME}} booking account.

Click the button below to set a new password. This link expires in 1 hour.

Reset Password: {{BASE_URL}}/reset-password?token={{token}}

If you didn't request this, you can safely ignore this email. Your password will remain unchanged.
```

Triggers and frequency:

- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password`: when the submitted email belongs to an active login-enabled member. The route always responds success to avoid enumeration. Rate limit: 5 requests per hour.
- `src/lib/xero-member-import.ts` member import path when `sendInvites` is true. It creates a 7-day token, but this template still says "1 hour".
- One email per matching member/imported member per triggering request.

### admin-password-reset

Subject:

```text
Reset your {{CLUB_NAME}} password
```

Body:

```text
Password Reset

An administrator has requested a password reset for your {{CLUB_NAME}} booking account.

Click the button below to set a new password. This link expires in {{expiryLabel}}.

Reset Password: {{BASE_URL}}/reset-password?token={{token}}

If you believe this was sent in error, please contact the club administrator.
```

Triggers and frequency:

- `POST /api/admin/members/send-password-reset`: admin sends reset links to 1-100 active login-enabled members.
- Expiry label is one of `1 hour`, `1 day`, or `3 days`.
- Bulk sends to more than one member are throttled to once per 10 minutes per admin, sent in batches of 10 with 1 second between batches.

### member-setup-invite

Subject:

```text
Set up your {{CLUB_NAME}} account (7-day link)
```

Body:

```text
Set Up Your Account

Hi {{firstName}},

An administrator has created your {{CLUB_NAME}} booking account.

Use the button below to set your password and activate your login. This link expires in 7 days.

Set Up My Password: {{BASE_URL}}/reset-password?token={{token}}

If you were not expecting this invite, you can safely ignore it or contact the club.
```

Triggers and frequency:

- Admin creates a member with `sendInvite`.
- Admin imports members with `sendInvites`.
- Admin uses `POST /api/admin/members/send-setup-invite`.
- One email per selected/new/imported member per admin action.
- Bulk sends have no per-admin cooldown: the 100-ids-per-request cap plus SES batch pacing (batches of 10, 1 second between batches) are the sole provider protections. The response reports honest per-member outcomes (`sent`, `failed`, and a `results` array) so the admin UI surfaces failures inside the dialog and can retry the members whose email did not deliver.

Triggers and frequency:

- Booking creation for zero-dollar bookings that become confirmed/paid immediately.
- Draft booking confirmation for zero-dollar confirmed drafts.
- Stripe `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook after primary booking payment succeeds.
- Pending-booking cron when a held pending booking reaches its deadline, capacity is still available, and payment succeeds or price is zero.
- Waitlist offer confirmation when it becomes paid without payment collection.
- Admin force-confirm of a waitlisted booking when final status is `PAID`.
- One email per successful confirmation event. No template-level dedupe was found.

### booking-pending

Subject:

```text
Booking Pending - {{CLUB_LODGE_NAME}}
```

Body:

```text
Booking Pending

Hi {{firstName}}, your lodge booking has been received and is currently pending.

Check-in: {{checkIn}}
Check-out: {{checkOut}}
Guests: {{guestCount}}
Hold Until: {{holdUntil}}

Your booking includes non-member guests and will be held as pending until {{holdUntil}}.

During this time, club members have priority. If the lodge fills up with member bookings, your booking may be bumped. Your card will only be charged when the booking is confirmed.

View Booking: {{BASE_URL}}/bookings
```

Triggers and frequency:

- Booking creation when status is `PENDING` and `nonMemberHoldUntil` exists.
- Waitlist offer confirmation when it transitions back to `PENDING`.
- One email per transition into that pending state. No template-level dedupe was found.

### booking-bumped

Subject:

```text
Booking Update - {{CLUB_LODGE_NAME}}
```

Body:

```text
Booking Update

Hi {{firstName}}, unfortunately your pending lodge booking has been bumped due to member demand.

Check-in: {{checkIn}}
Check-out: {{checkOut}}
Guests: {{guestCount}}

Your card has not been charged.

As a non-member booking, priority is given to club members when the lodge reaches capacity. You're welcome to rebook for different dates where availability exists.

Book Again: {{BASE_URL}}/book

We apologise for the inconvenience.
```

Triggers and frequency:

- Pending-booking cron every 3 hours when a pending booking reaches its hold deadline and capacity is no longer available.
- One email per bumped booking.

### booking-guests-cancelled

Subject:

```text
Booking Cancelled - {{CLUB_LODGE_NAME}}
```

Body:

```text
Booking Cancelled

Hi {{firstName}}, you asked us to cancel your whole booking if your non-member guests couldn't come. The lodge filled up with member bookings, so we've cancelled it.

Check-in: {{checkIn}}
Check-out: {{checkOut}}

Your card has not been charged.

You're welcome to rebook for different dates where availability exists.

Book Again: {{BASE_URL}}/book
```

Triggers and frequency:

- Pending-booking cron when a booking with the "only book if my guests can come" flag set loses capacity for its non-member guests.
- One email per cancelled booking. No refund — the booking was never charged.

### booking-cancelled

Subject:

```text
Booking Cancelled - {{CLUB_LODGE_NAME}}
```

Body:

```text
Booking Cancelled

Hi {{firstName}}, your lodge booking has been cancelled.

Check-in: {{checkIn}}
Check-out: {{checkOut}}

{{refundMessage}}

{{creditRestoredMessage}}

You can make a new booking at any time from your account.

Make a New Booking: {{BASE_URL}}/book
```

Refund message variants:

```text
A credit of {{refundAmount}} has been added to your account for future bookings.
```

```text
A refund of {{refundAmount}} has been processed to your original payment method.
```

```text
No refund was applicable based on the cancellation policy.
```

Restored-credit line (`{{creditRestoredMessage}}`, empty when no applied credit was
restored). Since #1164 the account credit originally applied to a booking is restored
subject to the same cancellation policy as the card slice, so it may be less than the
full amount applied:

```text
{{creditRestored}} of previously applied account credit has been restored to your account (per the cancellation policy).
```

Triggers and frequency:

- User/admin cancellation flow for waitlisted, waitlist-offered, pending, confirmed, paid, and no-refund bookings.
- One email per cancellation action after status is changed to `CANCELLED`.
- An admin / Booking Officer cancellation carries an explicit per-cancel choice
  (#1705, `notifyMember`): "Cancel without emailing" skips this email (including
  for linked provisional split children cancelled with the parent) and records
  `notifyMember: false` in the audit metadata. Member self-cancels always send.
  The Xero invoice email on the Internet Banking path is a payment instruction
  and is always sent regardless of the choice.
- Three cancellation flows are **deliberately always-notify** — outside the
  #1705 choice (owner decision 2026-07-10, #1730): joiner emails on a group
  organiser's group cancel, the admin review-rejection cancel, and
  deletion-request cleanup cancellations. The recipients are losing bookings
  they own; a missed email risks a member arriving for a stay that no longer
  exists.

### booking-modified

Triggers and frequency:

- Date modification route.
- Batch modification route.
- Guest add route.
- Guest remove route.
- One email per successful modification request.
- Admin / Booking Officer edits carry an explicit per-edit choice (#1696,
  `notifyMember`); the standalone guest-remove route honours the same flag for
  admins (#1705). "Without emailing" skips this email and records
  `notifyMember: false` in the audit metadata; member self-edits always send.

```

Triggers and frequency:

- Admin roster route email action for a lodge date.
- Sends one email per guest with an email address and assigned chores.
- For each guest that will be emailed, the route deletes old guest chore tokens for that guest/date before creating a new 48-hour token.
- Honors the `choreRoster` preference via the Option C hybrid resolver (#1285), evaluated in `admin-roster-service.ts` **before** the token is created so an opted-out recipient leaves no orphaned token: the guest's own preference wins, else the inheriting primary's (`inheritEmailFromId`), else send. Suppressed guests are reported in the response `skipped` count. Non-member guests have no preference and are always sent.

Use the button below to get started. If you don't have a member account yet, you'll be guided through joining first, then you can accept this invitation once your login is active.

Accept Invitation: {{BASE_URL}}/family-invite/{{token}}

This link expires on {{expiresAt}}.

If you weren't expecting this invitation, you can safely ignore it.
```

Triggers and frequency:

- A group-less member's "create family group" request (#1681) names a partner by
  email who is **not** a registered member (#1682). A single-use, hash-at-rest
  bearer token is minted carrying the family group id, invited email, and
  creator, and this invitation is emailed to that address.
- Sent once to the invited address when the token is minted. Admins can revoke
  an outstanding token from the family groups admin page.
- The claim link routes an unregistered recipient through the normal membership
  application first; once their login is active they return to the same link to
  accept. TTL is 30 days (vs the 7-day nomination link) to span the membership
  process.

If you weren't expecting this request, you can decline it or safely ignore this email.
```

Triggers and frequency:

- A member declares another registered login adult as their partner (#1742) —
  from the profile Partner card or by marking the named partner during family
  group creation. A `PENDING` `MemberPartnerLink` is created and this consent
  request is emailed to the target.
- Sent once per partner-link request. No email is sent for the one-step
  family-admin declaration (the target has no login) or admin assignment
  (see `partner-link-confirmed`).

### partner-link-confirmed

Triggers and frequency:

- A `CONFIRMED` partner link is removed (#1742): one partner dissolves it (the
  other partner is emailed) or an admin removes it (both members are emailed,
  once if they share an address). Declining or withdrawing a still-pending
  request sends no email.
- Sent once per removal per distinct recipient address.

Once you set your password, you can log in at any time to book stays, view your bookings, and manage your profile.

```

Triggers and frequency:

- Age-up cron, scheduled daily at 6:30 AM NZST.
- Candidate criteria: active member, cannot login yet, age tier is not ADULT, date of birth places them in the configured ADULT age tier at the season start date.
- Requires the member to have a unique login email and no email-inheritance source.
- Skips if a sent/queued `age-up-invitation` already exists for the member email.
- Rolls back the login upgrade/token if email delivery fails so a later cron can retry.

### age-up-parent-email-handoff

Subject:

```text

```

Body:

```text
Email Address Needed for {{memberName}}

Hi {{recipientName}},

{{memberName}} has reached the {{targetAgeTierLabel}} age tier. Before we can activate their own booking login, they need a unique email address on their member record.

They are currently using or inheriting another member's login email, so we have not enabled their login yet.

Please contact the club at {{SUPPORT_EMAIL}} with {{memberName}}'s preferred email address. Once it is updated, their booking login can be activated.
```

Triggers and frequency:

- Age-up cron, scheduled daily at 6:30 AM NZST.
- Sent to the parent, email-inheritance source, or existing shared-login holder when an ageing-up member still shares or inherits a login email.
- Does not include a token or login setup link.
- Leaves the ageing-up member unchanged: no login enablement, no setup token, and no age-tier update.
- Records an audit event keyed to the ageing-up member so the handoff is not resent every day; separate youths sharing the same recipient email are deduped independently.

### admin-minors-review

Subject:

```text
Review required: booking has only under-18 guests ({{memberName}})
```

Body:

```text
Booking Review Required

A paid booking was edited and now has only under-18 guests. It is blocked from lodge check-in until an admin reviews it.

{{reviewReason}}

Member: {{memberName}}
Check-in: {{checkIn}}
Check-out: {{checkOut}}
Guests: {{guestCount}}

Review Bookings: {{BASE_URL}}/admin/bookings
```

Triggers and frequency:

- A guest removal or batch edit newly drops a paid (capacity-holding) booking into a minors-only (no-adult) composition (F27 / #1372).
- The booking keeps its PAID status but is blocked from lodge check-in until an admin clears the review; sent once to opted-in admins per event. Not sent when the booking already carried a pending review or still has an adult.
- Gated by its own "Booking review required" (`adminBookingReviewRequired`) admin notification preference (#1422), separate from routine new-booking alerts, so muting new-booking mail does not silence this review alert.

### admin-owner-substitution

Subject:

```text
Owner substitution — reconcile Xero contact for booking request {{requestId}}
```

Body:

```text
Owner Substitution — Xero Reconciliation Required

An owner substitution occurred while converting booking request {{requestId}} into booking {{bookingId}}. The booking (and its Xero invoice) will bill a newly-created contact instead of the intended owner.

Action required: reconcile the invoice's contact in Xero — repoint it from the newly-created contact to the intended organisation.

Intended owner (should be billed): {{intendedMemberName}} ({{intendedMemberId}})
Substituted contact (currently billed): {{substituteMemberName}} ({{substituteMemberId}})
Reason: {{reason}}
Requester: {{requesterName}} ({{memberEmail}})
Check-in: {{checkIn}}
Check-out: {{checkOut}}

Review Bookings: {{BASE_URL}}/admin/bookings
```

Triggers and frequency:

- A held booking-request owner was no longer a valid non-login contact by the time the requester accepted (login enabled, archived, deactivated, role changed), so the accept substituted a fresh non-login contact to avoid failing the requester (issue #1255 residual-risk decision 1). Sent once per conversion that substitutes.
- Fires post-commit alongside the durable `booking_request.owner_substituted` audit row (F20 residual #2 / #1377); a failed send never fails the conversion.
- Gated by the "Xero sync errors" (`adminXeroSyncError`) admin notification preference, because the remedy is a Xero contact reconciliation (repoint the invoice's contact to the intended organisation) so the finance/Xero admin audience is the right recipient set.

### admin-partner-share-swept

Subject:

```text
Review required: shared double-bed placements removed ({{memberName}})
```

Body:

```text
Shared Double-Bed Placements Removed

A partner pair no longer qualifies for double-bed sharing, so their future shared placements were removed. The affected guest nights are back in the awaiting-allocation queue and may need re-planning on the allocation board.

Member: {{memberName}}
Partner: {{partnerName}}
Reason: {{reason}}
Removed night{{s}}: {{date}}

Review Bed Allocation: {{BASE_URL}}/admin/bed-allocation
```

Triggers and frequency:

- A CONFIRMED partner link was dissolved (member self-service or admin removal), a member was deactivated (member edit, bulk update, or account-deletion anonymisation), or an ADULT member was re-tiered to a minor/N-A tier, while the pair still held future `isSecondOccupant` shared double-bed allocations (#1756). The sweep removes the second occupant back to the awaiting-allocation queue inside the same transaction and audits both bookings; this alert fires post-commit.
- Sent once per event that removed at least one placement; a no-op sweep sends nothing. A failed send never fails the dissolve/deactivation.
- Gated by the "Booking review required" (`adminBookingReviewRequired`) admin notification preference — the queue entry needs a human re-plan on the allocation board, the same review-shaped audience as the minors-only alert.

### admin-new-booking

Triggers and frequency:

- Admin digest cron, scheduled daily at 7:30 AM NZST.
