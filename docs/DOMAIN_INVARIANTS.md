# Domain Invariants

These are non-negotiable business and technical rules for AlpineClubBookingsNZ.
Future reviews and issues should cite this file when proposing changes.

## Money

- Store and calculate money as integer cents.
- Do not introduce floating point money arithmetic.
- Refunds, credits, discounts, Stripe amounts, Xero invoice amounts, and
  membership fees must reconcile back to cent-based ledger records.
- Admin adjustments need audit, approval, and a visible business reason.

## Booking Dates And Capacity

- Lodge bookings use New Zealand date-only nights, not arbitrary timestamps,
  unless a feature explicitly requires time-of-day semantics.
- `BookingGuest.stayStart` and `BookingGuest.stayEnd` represent each guest's
  date-only occupancy inside the booking envelope.
- Only capacity-holding booking statuses consume beds. The implementation
  source of truth is `CAPACITY_HOLDING_BOOKING_STATUSES` in
  `src/lib/booking-status.ts`.
- Waitlisted and offered bookings do not consume capacity until confirmed.
- Draft, pending, waitlist, payment-recovery, and review states must have
  expiry, retry, admin visibility, or repair paths.

## Payment And Settlement

- Stripe and Internet Banking/Xero settlement paths must remain distinct.
- Stripe paths own PaymentIntents, SetupIntents, Stripe refunds, Stripe
  webhooks, and durable PaymentRecoveryOperation rows.
- Internet Banking bookings issue Xero-backed invoices and reconcile settlement
  through Xero invoice/payment state.
- Internet Banking defaults are non-holding and no-cutoff. If bed holding is
  enabled, the hold expiry is snapshotted on the Payment and must be released
  idempotently by cron if unpaid.
- Payment, refund, and credit operations must be idempotent across retries,
  webhook replays, cron reruns, and partial failure recovery.
- External provider side effects require clear retry and idempotency behavior.

## Booking Modifications

Booking changes must not orphan or desynchronize:

- Guests and per-guest stay ranges
- Payments and PaymentTransaction rows
- Refunds and member credits
- Xero invoices, payments, credit notes, and object links
- Bed allocations
- Audit records
- Emails and notification state
- Waitlist and capacity decisions

Positive deltas, negative deltas, credits, refunds, and additional payments must
remain traceable to the original booking and modification event.

## Membership Lifecycle

Membership application, nomination, cancellation, archive, delete, family, and
dependent changes must preserve financial history, booking and guest history,
audit history, required family/dependent history, privacy preferences, and Xero
contact/link history where required.

Access role, seasonal membership type, and committee assignment are separate
axes. `Member.role` controls application access, `SeasonalMembershipAssignment`
stores per-season membership policy, and committee assignment controls public
committee/contact presentation only. Do not add committee positions to
`Member.role`, and do not make booking, subscription, or Xero behavior depend on
membership type until the explicit enforcement issue changes those paths.

Pending nomination states must have an expiry, reminder, admin refresh,
replacement, rejection, or other documented recovery path so applications do
not remain permanently blocked by stale action links.

Hard delete must remain limited to records that pass the eligibility checks for
no durable booking, financial, family, Xero, or membership-history blockers.

## Integrations

- Webhooks and cron jobs must be idempotent.
- Provider callbacks must verify signatures, state, or expected origin before
  local mutation.
- External provider calls should not be placed inside long database
  transactions unless there is a documented reason.
- Email, Xero, and payment failures that affect business-critical outcomes must
  be visible and retryable.
- Logs, webhook records, Sentry events, and PR comments must not expose secrets,
  OAuth codes/states, action tokens, client secrets, or personal data beyond the
  minimum needed for diagnosis.

## Operations

- Production deployment must respect `docs/BLUE_GREEN_MIGRATION_POLICY.md`.
- Public CI and local validation must use test/demo credentials or placeholders.
- Production data, production backups, live provider accounts, and live webhooks
  are not valid exploratory test inputs.
