## Core Business Logic

### 1. Booking Flow
1. Member selects dates on availability calendar
2. System shows available beds (29 minus confirmed guests per night in range)
3. Minimum stay policy checked (e.g. 2 nights in winter peak)
4. Member adds themselves + guests (name, age tier, member/non-member)
5. System calculates price: SeasonRate for each guest's ageTier + isMember for each night; group discount applied if minGuests threshold met
6. Member optionally applies promo code, then account credit (MemberCredit ledger entries)
7. **If all guests are members OR checkIn ≤ 7 days away**: status = CONFIRMED, collect Stripe payment immediately
8. **If any guest is non-member AND checkIn > 7 days away**: status = PENDING, collect card via SetupIntent (no charge yet), set `nonMemberHoldUntil = checkIn - 7 days`
9. **If capacity exceeded on any night**: return 409 with `canWaitlist: true`; member can re-submit with `waitlist: true` (status = WAITLISTED, no payment)

### 2. Non-Member Priority Bumping (Last Booked = First Bumped)
When a member booking would fill the lodge past 29 beds on any night:
1. Find all PENDING bookings overlapping those nights
2. Sort by `createdAt DESC` (most recent first)
3. Bump one at a time until capacity restored
4. Each bumped booking: status = BUMPED, promo redemption cleaned up, notification sent

Concurrency guardrail:
- Capacity-sensitive booking, waitlist, force-confirm, and payment-intent writes share the same `pg_advisory_xact_lock(1)` inside the transaction.
- This intentionally serializes overlapping lodge-capacity decisions at current scale so overlapping date ranges cannot both consume the same beds.
- External payment and Xero calls are kept outside the lock-scoped transaction where possible to avoid holding the lock during network I/O.

### 3. Pending Booking Confirmation (Cron — every 3 hours)
1. Find PENDING bookings where `nonMemberHoldUntil <= now()`
2. Atomic claim (`updateMany WHERE status=PENDING`) before charging
3. Beds available + payment method saved → charge card, confirm, Xero invoice, email
4. No beds → bump + email

### 4. Pricing Engine
- For each night: determine Season, look up SeasonRate for guest's ageTier + isMember
- Group discount applied at booking level if minGuests threshold met
- All prices as integer cents
- Promo: FREE_NIGHTS (subtract cheapest N nights), PERCENTAGE (% off total), FIXED_AMOUNT (flat $ off)
- Account credit applied after promo discount

### 5. Cancellation & Refunds
- Admin-configurable policy: e.g. 14+ days = 100% refund, 7–14 days = 50%, <7 days = 0%
- Members cancel from booking detail page; if refund > $0, choose Stripe refund or account credit
- Stripe refund processed, Xero credit note created, promo redemption cleaned up
- Members can submit RefundRequest for out-of-policy appeals; admin reviews in admin panel

### 6. Waitlist
- WAITLISTED/WAITLIST_OFFERED bookings do NOT count toward capacity
- FIFO ordering by `createdAt ASC`; offer only when full date range has capacity
- 48h offer window (configurable via `WAITLIST_OFFER_HOURS`); no payment until confirmed
- Offer expiry handled by `cron-waitlist.ts` (every 30 min)

### 7. Chore Roster
- Admin configures chore templates (name, people count, min age, age restriction)
- Auto-suggests assignments via round-robin (4-day history lookback, occupancy scaling)
- Hut leader reviews, reassigns, confirms; printable A4 with `@media print`
- Guest chore tokens allow self-serve updates from kiosk

### 8. Membership Nomination Workflow
- New members submit MemberApplication with two nominator email addresses
- Nominators receive NominationToken via email; confirm via link
- Once both confirm, application goes to admin review
- Approval creates Member account + sends welcome email

### 9. Xero Integration (Bidirectional)
- **OAuth2:** Admin connects via admin panel; tokens encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- **Membership Verification:** Daily cron queries Xero invoices for subscription keywords, but only for members already linked to a `xeroContactId`; unlinked members remain `NOT_INVOICED` until linked
- **Booking Invoices:** On CONFIRMED + payment: find/create Contact, create Invoice with per-guest line items (item codes from XeroItemCodeMapping), record payment
- **Refund Sync:** Stripe refund → Xero credit note against original invoice
- **Inbound Reconciliation:** Xero webhook events stored as XeroInboundEvent, processed by 15-min cron safety net
- **Contact Sync:** Bidirectional — push member changes to Xero, pull contact updates back
- **Incremental Cache:** XeroContactCache/GroupCache for efficient sync without hammering API limits

### 10. Lodge Kiosk
- Separate PIN-based auth (`lodge-auth.ts`, `kiosk-access.ts`, `lodge-pin-session.ts`)
- 4 permission tiers: VIEW_ONLY, GUEST, HUT_LEADER, ADMIN
- Features: arrival display, expected arrival times, chore updates, issue reporting

### 11. Finance Dashboard
- Finance routes live under `/finance` and require explicit finance access through `Member.financeAccessLevel`; `ADMIN` alone does not grant finance visibility.
- `VIEWER` can read the landed finance workspace and reports. `MANAGER` can use manager-only finance actions such as Xero connection and manual sync controls.
- Finance Xero uses a separate OAuth app, token table, encryption key, tenant linkage, usage metering, and callback path from the operational Xero integration.
- Daily finance sync writes durable `FinanceSnapshot` rows for reporting datasets such as profit and loss, bank balances, and balance sheet data. Native booking reports use TACBookings booking/payment data directly.
- Finance report pages read stored snapshots or first-party booking data; normal report navigation does not make live Xero API calls.
- The legacy finance dashboard remains a fallback path until the rollout, freeze, and retirement runbooks in `docs/finance-dashboard/` are completed.

### 12. Token Storage
- Password reset, email verification, email change, and guest chore bearer tokens are stored as SHA-256 hashes in `tokenHash` columns.
- Incoming raw token values are hashed before lookup, so plaintext bearer tokens are not stored in the database after migration.
- Membership nomination tokens currently remain in their own `NominationToken` workflow and are not part of the hashed action-token migration documented in `docs/HASHED_TOKEN_MIGRATION.md`.

## Deployment (AWS Lightsail)

**Instance:** 4 GB RAM, 2 vCPUs, 80 GB SSD, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.

**Docker Compose services:** `caddy` (reverse proxy, auto HTTPS), `app` (cron leader and warm fallback upstream), `app_blue` / `app_green` (blue/green web slots), `postgres` (PostgreSQL 16 on port 5432), `migrate` (Prisma migration runner).

**Deploy process:**
```bash
./scripts/run-production-blue-green-deploy.sh
```

**Current deploy behavior:** `scripts/run-production-blue-green-deploy.sh` is the single supported production entrypoint. It snapshots the resolved `origin/main` commit into a clean workspace under `~/tacbookings-deployments/`, copies the production `.env`, preserves the live Caddy upstream state, invokes the low-level `scripts/blue-green-deploy.sh` runner there, then fast-forwards the clean `~/TACBookings` checkout to the deployed commit and prunes stale deploy workspaces after success.

**Blue/green guidance:** The blue/green path keeps Postgres shared, runs cron only on `app`, and keeps `app_blue` / `app_green` web-only by setting `CRON_ENABLED=false` on the color services. Caddy routes to the active color first and `app` second using readiness checks on `/api/health/ready`. During cutover, the previous color is kept running until the public domain verifies against the target color and the drain period ends. After a successful cutover, the non-target web-slot containers are removed so old code cannot continue running outside the active slot. Prisma changes must follow an expand-contract pattern so old and new app versions can overlap safely during cutover. The migration SQL scan in `scripts/blue-green-deploy.sh` is heuristic only and requires explicit operator review even when it passes. The low-level runner also supports `SKIP_APP_IMAGE_BUILD=1` when operators intentionally want to reuse existing app images.

**Backups:** Lightsail snapshots + daily pg_dump to S3 (env vars: `BACKUP_ENABLED`, `BACKUP_S3_BUCKET`, `BACKUP_S3_REGION`, `BACKUP_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `BACKUP_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS`, `BACKUP_CRON_SCHEDULE`).

**Environment variables:** See `.env.example` for full list. Key vars:
- `DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `XERO_CLIENT_ID`, `XERO_CLIENT_SECRET`, `XERO_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- `FINANCE_XERO_CLIENT_ID`, `FINANCE_XERO_CLIENT_SECRET`, `FINANCE_XERO_REDIRECT_URI`, `FINANCE_XERO_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `AWS_SES_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`

**Stripe:** Live keys in production (since 2026-04-08). Use test mode for development.
**Xero:** Connected to production org. Test against demo org for risky changes.
