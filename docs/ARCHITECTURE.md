# Architecture

AlpineClubBookingsNZ is a full-stack TypeScript monolith for club booking and membership
operations. It is built around Next.js App Router route handlers,
Prisma/PostgreSQL, Stripe, Xero, AWS SES, cron jobs, and Docker Compose
deployment.

## Runtime Shape

```text
Browser
  |
  v
Caddy reverse proxy
  |
  v
Next.js app container
  |
  +-- PostgreSQL 16
  +-- Stripe API and webhooks
  +-- Xero API and webhooks
  +-- AWS SES SMTP and SNS feedback
  +-- Sentry and structured logs
```

The production Compose model runs:

- `caddy` for HTTP/HTTPS routing
- `app` as the cron leader and warm fallback upstream
- `app_blue` and `app_green` as web-only blue/green slots
- `postgres` as the database
- `migrate` as an explicit Prisma migration runner

## Project Structure

```text

deploy/                         production proxy/runtime support files
```

Important route groups:

- `src/app/(public)` contains unauthenticated pages such as login, join, FAQ,
  contact, reset password, nomination, and public token flows.
- `src/app/(authenticated)` contains member dashboard, booking, profile, family,
  and booking-detail pages.
- `src/app/(admin)` contains administrative operations for members, member CSV
  import, bookings, bed allocation, payments, reports, lodge, Xero, audit logs,
  and policies.
- `src/app/api` contains route handlers for auth, bookings, payments, admin,
  finance, lodge, webhooks, cron, and health checks.

## Module Boundaries

This application is intentionally still a single Next.js monolith. The
important boundary is not process separation; it is keeping route handlers thin,
business rules testable, and integration code behind narrow helpers.

Use these ownership boundaries when adding new code:

| Area | Primary paths | Rule of thumb |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Club configuration | `config/`, `src/config/` | Club identity, capacities, rates, and feature switches must come from config or environment, not hard-coded deployment values. |
| Pages and route handlers | `src/app/` | Validate input and session state near the route boundary, then delegate decisions to `src/lib/`. |
| Route-private admin UI | `src/app/(admin)/admin/xero/_components`, `src/app/(admin)/admin/xero/_hooks`, `src/app/(admin)/admin/members/**/_components`, `src/app/(admin)/admin/members/**/_hooks` | Large admin routes should be route shells plus local components/hooks before moving anything to shared UI. |
| Shared UI | `src/components/` | Reusable view pieces live here; route-specific view state can stay beside the page until it is reused. |
| Booking lifecycle | `src/lib/booking-create.ts`, `src/lib/booking-modify.ts`, `src/lib/booking-payment-cleanup.ts`, `src/lib/payment-recovery.ts` | Keep route handlers thin; booking orchestration and durable payment recovery live behind these services. |
| Bed allocation | `src/lib/bed-allocation.ts`, `src/lib/bed-allocation-lifecycle.ts`, `src/lib/admin-bed-allocation.ts` | Room/bed inventory, family-aware allocation planning, lifecycle reconciliation, manual admin allocation, and approval state live behind focused services. |
| Policy rules | `src/lib/policies/` | Pricing, age-tier, cancellation, change-fee, minimum-stay, member-credit, and booking-route decisions live as testable policy helpers. |
| Operational Xero | `src/lib/xero-*.ts`, `src/lib/xero.ts` | `src/lib/xero.ts` is a compatibility facade. New code should import from the focused module that owns the behavior, not from the facade. |
| Admin/member services | `src/lib/admin-member-xero-actions.ts`, `src/lib/member-serialization.ts`, `src/lib/member-lifecycle-actions.ts`, `src/lib/membership-cancellation-*.ts` | Shared admin/member request wrappers, DTO shape, lifecycle actions, and cancellation workflows live outside page files. |
| Business logic | `src/lib/` | Keep money in integer cents, dates as New Zealand date-only lodge nights, and external calls outside long database transactions where practical. |
| Database | `prisma/schema.prisma`, `prisma/migrations/` | Schema changes must include deployable migrations and respect the blue/green migration policy. |
| Operations | `scripts/`, `deploy/`, Compose files | Deployment helpers should be reusable by forks through environment overrides. |

The largest current files are historical consolidation points rather than a
preferred style. When changing them, extract focused helpers around the code
being touched and keep tests close to the extracted domain helper so public
adopters can find the contract without reading the whole application.

### Xero integration layers

`src/lib/xero.ts` is a 199-line compatibility facade for older imports. Prefer
direct imports from the focused modules below for new code.

| Concern | Focused modules | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Infrastructure | `xero-oauth`, `xero-token-store`, `xero-api-client`, `xero-mappings`, `xero-sync-cursors` | OAuth, encrypted tokens, metered/retried API calls, mapping lookup, and sync cursors. |
| Contacts | `xero-contacts`, `xero-contact-cache`, `xero-contact-groups`, `xero-duplicate-contacts`, `xero-bulk-contact-sync`, `xero-member-import` | Contact CRUD, local caches, managed groups, duplicate suggestions, bulk sync, and member import. |
| Membership | `xero-membership-sync` | Subscription invoice discovery, status checks, history flushing, and linked-contact sync. |
| Invoice documents | `xero-invoice-helpers`, `xero-invoice-payments`, `xero-booking-invoices`, `xero-credit-notes`, `xero-supplementary-invoices`, `xero-modification-credit-notes`, `xero-entrance-fee-invoices` | Booking invoices, entrance-fee invoices, supplementary invoices, payments, refunds, credit notes, and allocation helpers. |
| Operations and admin support | `xero-sync`, `xero-operation-outbox`, `xero-operation-retry`, `xero-operation-queue`, `xero-record-activity`, `xero-record-links`, `xero-hardening`, `xero-inbound-reconciliation`, `xero-booking-repair`, `xero-contact-link-mismatches`, `xero-contact-sync`, `xero-booking-edit-settlement`, `xero-admin-cache`, `xero-admin-failures`, `xero-admin-health`, `xero-api-usage`, `xero-api-errors`, `xero-config`, `xero-error-alert`, `xero-error-shape`, `xero-feature-flags`, `xero-links`, `xero-oauth-state`, `xero-record-types` | Existing boundaries for queues, reconciliation, repair tooling, admin health, diagnostics, config, links, and error handling. |

### Booking lifecycle boundary

`src/lib/booking-create.ts` owns booking creation orchestration after route
validation: capacity locking, pricing, promo/member-credit decisions,
persistence, audit, emails, and Xero queueing. `src/lib/booking-modify.ts` owns
the modification boundary for date/guest/promo changes and delegates reusable
decisions to helpers and `src/lib/policies/`.

`src/lib/booking-payment-cleanup.ts` queues superseded Stripe PaymentIntents
when booking edits replace or zero out pending payment work.
`src/lib/payment-recovery.ts` is the durable recovery queue that cancels open
intents, treats already-cancelled intents as complete, and refunds late
captures without re-entering the normal booking-confirmation path.

### Admin/member layer

The `/admin/xero` and `/admin/members` routes are route shells with local
`_components` and `_hooks` folders. Shared admin/member logic lives in
`src/lib/`: `admin-member-xero-actions` wraps the Xero contact actions used by
both the members list and detail page, `member-serialization` centralises DTO
shape, `member-lifecycle-actions` owns archive/delete request handling, and
`membership-cancellation-*` owns the cancellation request, confirmation,
approval, Xero, settings, and status-label flow.

## Core Data Model

The source of truth is `prisma/schema.prisma`. Key domains are:

- Members, family groups, dependent relationships, nominations, membership
  cancellation requests, setup invites, password/email tokens, notification
  preferences, deletion requests, and audit logs.
- Seasons, season rates, booking periods, minimum-stay policies, group
  discounts, age-tier settings, promo codes, fixed-nightly promo adjustments,
  and promo redemptions.
- Bookings, guests, payments, refunds, booking modifications, waitlist offers,
  account-credit ledger entries, chores, hut-leader assignments, lodge PIN
  sessions, and issue reports.
- Lodge rooms, lodge beds, bed allocations, allocation settings, and allocation
  approval metadata.
- Operational Xero tokens, object links, cache tables, inbound events,
  operation queues, account/item mappings, and API usage metering.
- Finance Xero tokens, finance sync runs, finance snapshots, finance usage
  metering, and finance access levels.
- Cron run records, email logs, webhook logs, processed webhook events, and
  backup/audit-retention support records.

## Booking and Payment Flow

1. A member selects check-in and check-out dates.
2. Capacity is calculated as lodge beds minus capacity-holding guests per
   night. Only bookings with money committed hold beds: `PAID`, `COMPLETED`,
   `CONFIRMED` (pay-on-account school groups), and `AWAITING_REVIEW` (a bed is
   reserved while an admin decides). `PENDING` does not hold capacity; it is a
   provisional non-member hold. The single source of truth is
   `CAPACITY_HOLDING_BOOKING_STATUSES` in `src/lib/booking-status.ts`.
3. Minimum-stay, booking-window, age-tier, membership, group-discount, fixed or
   percentage promo, and account-credit rules are applied.
4. If all guests are members, or check-in is within the non-member hold window,
   the booking can proceed to payment immediately.
5. If non-members are included outside the hold window, a card can be saved and
   the booking remains pending until the hold date.
6. `BookingGuest.stayStart` and `BookingGuest.stayEnd` record the actual
   date-only range for each guest inside the parent booking envelope. Capacity,
   lodge lists, rosters, and booking-derived finance metrics count a guest only
   on nights in that individual range.
7. Capacity-sensitive writes use a PostgreSQL advisory transaction lock so
   overlapping booking decisions serialize at the current lodge scale.
   Member lifecycle approval (delete / archive) acquires
   `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('member-lifecycle:<memberId>'))` inside
   the transaction. Future approve / reject paths that recount eligibility
   then mutate the member graph should follow the same idiom so a parallel
   write cannot race the re-check.
8. Payment state records an explicit source. Stripe payments stay on Stripe
   PaymentIntent, refund, and recovery paths; Internet Banking payments issue a
   Xero invoice and settle through inbound Xero reconciliation.
9. Bed allocations reconcile when bookings are confirmed, modified, waitlist
   confirmed, force-confirmed, cancelled, completed, or deleted. Automatic
   allocation can fill missing guest nights from active room/bed inventory, and
   admins can manually move or approve allocations.

In-progress member self-service edits are limited to future unused nights from
NZ tomorrow onward. NZ today and earlier are locked for admin review through
booking change requests. Positive booking-edit deltas use supplementary Xero
invoices after additional Stripe payment succeeds, while negative deltas use a
settlement choice: Stripe refund work where applicable or an idempotent
source-linked member account credit. Both avoid unsafe financial mutation of a
paid, part-paid, credited, or locked original invoice.

Money values are integer cents. Booking dates are New Zealand date-only lodge
nights rather than timestamps.

## Booking Statuses

Common booking states include:

- `DRAFT` for unconfirmed drafts with a time-to-live
- `PENDING` for non-member hold bookings
- `CONFIRMED` and `PAID` for accepted bookings
- `WAITLISTED` and `WAITLIST_OFFERED` for capacity waitlist flows
- `BUMPED`, `CANCELLED`, and `COMPLETED` for lifecycle transitions

Waitlisted and offered bookings do not consume capacity until confirmed.
Completed bookings continue to consume capacity for their remaining stay nights.

## Admin and Lodge

Admin pages cover member management, member CSV import, bookings, operational
booking filters, bed allocation, payments, seasons, policies, refund requests,
promo codes, communications, health, audit logs, reports, Xero operations and
inbound-event drilldowns, committee data, issue reports, waitlist, lodge
operations, hut leaders, and roster/chores.

Membership cancellation is a member-initiated account lifecycle workflow.
Requests can include the requester, dependants, non-login adults, and related
family adults. Login-capable adults receive their own confirmation link before
admin review. Admin approval disables the local membership, clears operational
family/email-inheritance links, preserves financial and lodge history, and
queues Xero cancellation operations.

Cancelled members can be archived through `MemberLifecycleActionRequest` with
the `ARCHIVE` action. Archive requires a reason and approval by a different
admin through the `/admin/membership-cancellations` review queue. Approval keeps
the member record and related history but marks it archived, inactive, and
non-login so default operational lists exclude it.

Member records created in error use `MemberLifecycleActionRequest` with the
`DELETE` action. A delete request requires a reason, approval by a different
admin, a clean eligibility check with no booking, financial, family, Xero, or
membership history blockers, and a retained member snapshot before hard
deletion. Direct `DELETE /api/admin/members/[id]` is intentionally disabled.

The lodge kiosk has its own PIN session model and permission tiers for
view-only, guest, hut-leader, and admin-style lodge actions. It supports guest
arrival/departure, expected arrival times, chores, and issue reporting without
exposing the full admin interface.

## Integrations

### Stripe

Stripe is used for PaymentIntents, SetupIntents, saved payment methods, refunds,
and webhook reconciliation. Webhook routes should be idempotent and must not
trust client-supplied payment state. Internet Banking payments are explicitly
excluded from Stripe-only PaymentIntent, refund, and recovery paths.

Superseded Stripe PaymentIntents that can no longer settle a booking are tracked
through `PaymentRecoveryOperation`. The recovery worker cancels still-open
intents, treats already-cancelled intents as complete, and queues/refunds late
captures without running the normal booking-confirmation path.

### Operational Xero

Operational Xero handles member/contact sync, booking invoices, payments,
credit notes, item codes, contact groups, inbound webhooks, local caches, retry
queues, and usage metering. Xero tokens are encrypted at rest.
Internet Banking bookings use this boundary to issue invoice-backed payment
instructions and reconcile settlement from inbound Xero invoice/payment state.

### Finance Xero

Finance Xero is a separate OAuth boundary with separate token storage,
encryption keys, tenant linkage, callback route, usage metering, and sync
service. Finance pages normally read stored snapshots or first-party booking
data rather than calling Xero during page render.

### Email

AWS SES SMTP sends transactional email. SES SNS feedback is ingested for bounce
and complaint suppression. Email templates should avoid embedding secrets and
should use effective recipient logic for dependents where required. Editable
templates and admin/system delivery policies are registered in the email
message registry and surfaced in Admin Setup and Admin Notifications.
Membership cancellation, archive, and hard-delete lifecycle messages use that
registry so operators can preview and override copy without bypassing the
shared `sendEmail` path.

## Cron Jobs

Cron jobs run inside the `app` cron-leader container. Web-only blue/green slots
disable cron with `CRON_ENABLED=false`.

## Security and Privacy Boundaries

- Auth uses credentials sessions with explicit admin and finance guards.
- Finance access is separate from general admin access.
- Public bearer tokens are stored hashed or encrypted according to use case.
- Logs, Sentry events, and webhook records should be redacted before storing or
  emitting sensitive values.
- Mutation routes should validate inputs with structured schemas and enforce
  role/session checks close to the route boundary.
- External service callbacks and webhooks must verify signatures, state, or
  expected origin data before mutating local state.

## Deployment and Migrations

Production deployment uses the blue/green runner documented in `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
Database migrations must follow `docs/BLUE_GREEN_MIGRATION_POLICY.md` so old
and new app versions can overlap safely during cutover.

Staging and accessibility checks use `docker-compose.staging.yml`,
`Caddyfile.staging`, `.env.staging.example`, and the workflow in
`docs/STAGING_ACCESSIBILITY.md`.

## Configuration

The environment contract is documented in `.env.example` and
`.env.staging.example`. Use test or demo service credentials outside production.
Do not commit real `.env`, database dumps, generated reports, logs, or build
artifacts.
