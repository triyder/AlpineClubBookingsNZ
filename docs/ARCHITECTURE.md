# Architecture

AlpineClubBookingsNZ is a full-stack TypeScript monolith for club booking and membership
operations. It is built around Next.js App Router route handlers,
Prisma/PostgreSQL, Stripe, Xero, AWS SES, cron jobs, and Docker Compose
deployment.

## Runtime Shape

```text
Browser
  |
  v
Caddy reverse proxy
  |
  v
Next.js app container
  |
  +-- PostgreSQL 16
  +-- Stripe API and webhooks
  +-- Xero API and webhooks
  +-- AWS SES SMTP and SNS feedback
  +-- Sentry and structured logs
```

The production Compose model runs:

- `caddy` for HTTP/HTTPS routing
- `app` as the cron leader and warm fallback upstream
- `app_blue` and `app_green` as web-only blue/green slots
- `postgres` as the database
- `migrate` as an explicit Prisma migration runner

Important route groups:

- `src/app/(public)` contains unauthenticated pages such as login, register,
  password reset, email verification, payment, and public token flows.
- `src/app/(authenticated)` contains member dashboard, booking, profile, family,
  and booking-detail pages.
- `src/app/(admin)` contains administrative operations for members, member CSV
  import, bookings, bed allocation, payments, reports, lodge, Xero, audit logs,
  and policies.
- `src/app/api` contains route handlers for auth, bookings, payments, admin,
  finance, lodge, webhooks, cron, and health checks.

## Module Boundaries

This application is intentionally still a single Next.js monolith. The
important boundary is not process separation; it is keeping route handlers thin,
business rules testable, and integration code behind narrow helpers.

Use these ownership boundaries when adding new code:

| Area | Primary paths | Rule of thumb |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Club configuration | `config/`, `src/config/` | Club identity, capacities, rates, and feature switches must come from config or environment, not hard-coded deployment values. |
| Pages and route handlers | `src/app/` | Validate input and session state near the route boundary, then delegate decisions to `src/lib/`. |
| Route-private page UI | `src/app/(admin)/admin/xero/_components`, `src/app/(admin)/admin/xero/_hooks`, `src/app/(admin)/admin/members/**/_components`, `src/app/(admin)/admin/members/**/_hooks`, `src/app/(authenticated)/book/_components` | Large routes should be route shells plus local components/hooks before moving anything to shared UI. |
| Shared UI | `src/components/` | Reusable view pieces live here; route-specific view state can stay beside the page until it is reused. |
| Booking lifecycle | `src/lib/booking-create.ts`, `src/lib/booking-create-types.ts`, `src/lib/booking-create-promo.ts`, `src/lib/booking-create-guests.ts`, `src/lib/booking-modify.ts` (barrel over `booking-modify-validation` / `booking-modify-plan` / `booking-modify-settlement`), `src/lib/booking-payment-cleanup.ts`, `src/lib/payment-recovery.ts` | Keep route handlers thin; booking orchestration and durable payment recovery live behind these services. |
| Bed allocation | `src/lib/bed-allocation.ts`, `src/lib/bed-allocation-lifecycle.ts`, `src/lib/admin-bed-allocation.ts` | Room/bed inventory, family-aware allocation planning, lifecycle reconciliation, manual admin allocation, and approval state live behind focused services. Each `LodgeBed` carries a descriptive **bed type** (`SINGLE` / `BUNK_TOP` / `BUNK_BOTTOM` / `DOUBLE`) and an optional `bunkGroup` label; a group holds at most two beds — one top and one bottom — enforced in `admin-bed-allocation.ts` (serialised by a room-row lock, no partial index) and shown as an icon on the setup list and allocation board (#1675). Bed type is display-only in v1: capacity stays one person per bed per night (`@@unique([bedId, stayDate])` unchanged). Beds may be pre-assigned on provisional statuses (`BED_ALLOCATABLE_BOOKING_STATUSES`) before a booking holds capacity, so the admin board tags each bed **Held** vs **Provisional** (#1251). The state is a server-computed flag from `bookingHoldsCapacity` (booking-status.ts) — not a per-row status check — because holding is no longer purely status-based: an accepted-but-unpaid quote is `PENDING` but holds (#1254). In the AUTOMATIC on-payment/confirmation reconcile (`bed-allocation-lifecycle.ts` → the planner's `prioritizeCapacityHolding` mode), **capacity-holding bookings get first claim**: they are allocated before provisional ones, and a held booking blocked only by a **Provisional** allocation moves that provisional aside (to a free bed) — or, if the night is otherwise full, unallocates it back to the awaiting-allocation queue — then takes the freed bed. A **Held** or admin-**approved** (#776 lock) allocation is never displaced, and displacement never strands a same-booking minor; each displacement is applied atomically and writes a `lodge` audit row on the displaced provisional booking (#1387). That automatic reconcile auto-places **only the reconciled booking's own** guests on its current nights (#1686): editing, confirming, promoting, or cancelling one booking never opportunistically drafts *other* bookings' guests into idle or freed beds — a cancellation's freed beds stay in the awaiting-allocation queue rather than being auto-refilled. It still loads lodge-wide occupancy so it can seat that booking whole-stay and displace blocking provisionals to seat a held booking (#1387/#1677); opportunistic lodge-wide re-planning of *everyone* is exclusively the explicit board action below. The manual board **Run auto-allocation** button (`runAutoBedAllocation`) runs pure first-fit and does NOT displace — only the automatic reconcile does. |
| Policy rules | `src/lib/policies/` | Pricing, age-tier, cancellation, change-fee, minimum-stay, member-credit, and booking-route decisions live as testable policy helpers. |
| Operational Xero | `src/lib/xero-*.ts`, `src/lib/xero.ts` | `src/lib/xero.ts` is a compatibility facade. New code should import from the focused module that owns the behavior, not from the facade. |
| Admin/member services | `src/lib/admin-member-xero-actions.ts`, `src/lib/member-serialization.ts`, `src/lib/member-lifecycle-actions.ts`, `src/lib/membership-cancellation-*.ts` | Shared admin/member request wrappers, DTO shape, lifecycle actions, and cancellation workflows live outside page files. |
| Business logic | `src/lib/` | Keep money in integer cents, dates as New Zealand date-only lodge nights, and external calls outside long database transactions where practical. |
| Database | `prisma/schema.prisma`, `prisma/migrations/` | Schema changes must include deployable migrations and respect the blue/green migration policy. |
| Operations | `scripts/`, `deploy/`, Compose files | Deployment helpers should be reusable by forks through environment overrides. |

The largest current files are historical consolidation points rather than a
preferred style. When changing them, extract focused helpers around the code
being touched and keep tests close to the extracted domain helper so public
adopters can find the contract without reading the whole application.

### Xero integration layers

`src/lib/xero.ts` is a compatibility facade (re-exports only) for older
imports. Prefer direct imports from the focused modules below for new code.
[`docs/xero/ARCHITECTURE.md`](xero/ARCHITECTURE.md) maps the subsystem in
depth: runtime dataflow, ledger data model, and sequence diagrams for the
outbound-document, inbound-reconciliation, and repair flows.

| Concern | Focused modules | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Infrastructure | `xero-oauth`, `xero-token-store`, `xero-api-client`, `xero-mappings`, `xero-sync-cursors` | OAuth, encrypted tokens, metered/retried API calls, mapping lookup, and sync cursors. |
| Contacts | `xero-contacts`, `xero-contact-cache`, `xero-contact-groups`, `xero-duplicate-contacts`, `xero-bulk-contact-sync`, `xero-member-import` | Contact CRUD, local caches, managed groups, duplicate suggestions, bulk sync, and member import. |
| Membership | `xero-membership-sync` | Subscription invoice discovery, status checks, history flushing, and linked-contact sync. |
| Invoice documents | `xero-invoice-helpers`, `xero-invoice-payments`, `xero-booking-invoices`, `xero-credit-notes`, `xero-supplementary-invoices`, `xero-modification-credit-notes`, `xero-entrance-fee-invoices` | Booking invoices, entrance-fee invoices, supplementary invoices, payments, refunds, credit notes, and allocation helpers. |
| Operations and admin support | `xero-sync`, `xero-operation-outbox`, `xero-operation-retry`, `xero-operation-queue`, `xero-record-activity`, `xero-record-links`, `xero-hardening`, `xero-inbound-reconciliation`, `xero-booking-repair`, `xero-contact-link-mismatches`, `xero-contact-sync`, `xero-booking-edit-settlement`, `xero-admin-cache`, `xero-admin-failures`, `xero-admin-health`, `xero-api-usage`, `xero-api-errors`, `xero-config`, `xero-error-alert`, `xero-error-shape`, `xero-feature-flags`, `xero-links`, `xero-oauth-state`, `xero-record-types` | Existing boundaries for queues, reconciliation, repair tooling, admin health, diagnostics, config, links, and error handling. |

### Booking lifecycle boundary

`src/lib/booking-create.ts` owns booking creation orchestration after route
validation: capacity locking, pricing, promo/member-credit decisions,
persistence, audit, emails, and Xero queueing. It keeps the three creation
orchestrators (`createDraftBooking`, `createConfirmedBooking`,
`createWaitlistedBooking` — the advisory-lock transactions, person-night guard,
and capacity checks) and re-exports the pure helpers now split into
`src/lib/booking-create-types.ts` (shared input/result types and errors),
`src/lib/booking-create-promo.ts` (promo/pricing resolution), and
`src/lib/booking-create-guests.ts` (guest-persistence, capacity-range, and
admin-review helpers), so `@/lib/booking-create` keeps its exact import surface.
`src/lib/booking-modify.ts` owns
the modification boundary for date/guest/promo changes and delegates reusable
decisions to helpers and `src/lib/policies/`. It is a barrel over three
modules split out in issue #1138 — `booking-modify-validation.ts`
(edit-eligibility gates and shared loaded types), `booking-modify-plan.ts`
(the in-transaction guest/pricing/promo pipeline), and
`booking-modify-settlement.ts` (settlement handoff and lifecycle
transitions) — so importers keep using `@/lib/booking-modify` unchanged.

`src/lib/booking-payment-cleanup.ts` queues superseded Stripe PaymentIntents
when booking edits replace or zero out pending payment work.
`src/lib/payment-recovery.ts` is the durable recovery queue that cancels open
intents, treats already-cancelled intents as complete, and refunds late
captures without re-entering the normal booking-confirmation path.

### Admin/member layer

`/admin/stuck-states` is the consolidated operator queue for cross-domain
recovery visibility. `src/lib/stuck-state-dashboard.ts` aggregates local
payment recovery, operational Xero, email deliverability, waitlist,
bed-allocation, hut-leader, and issue-report signals into severity, owner, and
target links without making live provider calls during page render.
`src/lib/booking-provider-mismatches.ts` answers the same provider-divergence
questions for a single booking (paid with no completed Xero invoice operation,
Stripe refund with no Xero credit note, waitlist offer whose email needs
operator action) and feeds the amber "Provider state out of step" block on the
booking detail Admin tools card — read-only detection mirroring the
stuck-state queries.

The `/admin/xero` and `/admin/members` routes are route shells with local
`_components` and `_hooks` folders; the member `/book` wizard follows the same
shape, keeping its wizard-step views in `src/app/(authenticated)/book/_components`
and its state machine (all wizard state, effects, and handlers) in the
`src/app/(authenticated)/book/_hooks/use-booking-wizard` hook, with the page
shell as a thin consumer that renders the step views. Shared admin/member logic lives in
`src/lib/`: `admin-member-xero-actions` wraps the Xero contact actions used by
both the members list and detail page, `member-serialization` centralises DTO
shape, `member-lifecycle-actions` owns archive/delete request handling, and
`membership-cancellation-*` owns the cancellation request, confirmation,
approval, Xero, settings, and status-label flow.

## Core Data Model

The source of truth is `prisma/schema.prisma`. Key domains are:

- Members, family groups, hidden family-suggestion member sets, dependent
  relationships, nominations, membership cancellation requests, setup invites,
  password/email tokens, two-factor enrollment state, hashed email
  OTP/recovery-code rows, notification preferences, deletion requests, and
  audit logs.
- Seasons, season rates, booking periods, minimum-stay policies, group
  discounts, age-tier settings, promo codes, fixed-nightly promo adjustments,
  and promo redemptions.
- Bookings, guests, payments, refunds, booking modifications, waitlist offers,
  account-credit ledger entries, chores, hut-leader assignments, lodge PIN
  sessions, and issue reports.
- Lodge rooms, lodge beds, bed allocations, allocation settings, and allocation
  approval metadata.
- Operational Xero tokens, object links, cache tables, inbound events,
  operation queues, account/item mappings, and API usage metering.
- Finance sync runs, finance snapshots, chart-of-accounts snapshots, finance
  report diagnostics, and finance access levels, all using the operational Xero
  connection rather than a separate finance token store.
- Cron run records, email logs, webhook logs, processed webhook events, and
  backup/audit-retention support records.
- Public website content records: `PageContent` owns routable page
  header/body/menu content, while `SiteContent` owns shared public chrome such
  as the editable footer columns that never appear in the website menu.
- `SiteBanner` records: admin-managed plain-text notices with
  `URGENT`/`WARNING`/`NOTIFY` priority and an inclusive NZ date-only display
  window, rendered above the public and member site headers.

## Booking and Payment Flow

1. A member selects a lodge (implicit when only one active lodge exists) and
   check-in and check-out dates.
2. Capacity is calculated per lodge as that lodge's beds minus its
   capacity-holding guests per night; capacity is never summed across lodges,
   and a booking at one lodge never consumes another lodge's beds.
   Capacity-holding statuses are `PAID`, `COMPLETED`, `CONFIRMED`
   (pay-on-account school groups + accepted-but-unpaid school quotes), and
   `AWAITING_REVIEW` (a bed is reserved while an admin decides, and for the
   "sent quote" hold). Generic `PENDING` does not hold capacity (a provisional
   non-member hold) — but a `PENDING` booking that is the converted booking of a
   `BookingRequest` (an accepted-but-unpaid quote or a directly-approved
   request) DOES hold until it is paid, expires, or is cancelled (issue #1254,
   refining #737). The single source of truth is `capacityHoldingBookingFilter()`
   (query form) and `bookingHoldsCapacity()` (per-row form) in
   `src/lib/booking-status.ts`, composed under `AND` with the per-lodge scope.
3. Minimum-stay, booking-window, age-tier, membership, group-discount, fixed or
   percentage promo, and account-credit rules are applied.
4. Booking Policies resolve the effective non-member hold policy from the
   check-in date: a date-specific `BookingPeriod` can override both the
   default enabled flag and the confirmation threshold. Existing clubs default
   to Members First (`nonMemberHoldEnabled=true`), while First Paid, First In
   disables provisional non-member holds for that policy row. The Default
   Cancellation Policy admin page nudges operators to refresh their public
   Terms/FAQ when that copy still describes the old hold behaviour and omits the
   First Paid, First In option (`detectStaleHoldPolicyCopy` in
   `src/lib/hold-policy-copy.ts`).
5. If all guests are members, the non-member hold policy is disabled, or
   check-in is inside the configured hold window, the whole booking proceeds to
   normal payment immediately.
6. If non-members are included outside an enabled Members First hold window, a
   card can be saved and the non-member portion remains pending until the hold
   date. Mixed member/non-member parties split only in this pending case; inside
   the window or under First Paid, First In they stay one normal booking.
7. `BookingGuest.stayStart` and `BookingGuest.stayEnd` record the actual
   date-only range for each guest inside the parent booking envelope. Capacity,
   lodge lists, rosters, and booking-derived finance metrics count a guest only
   on nights in that individual range.
8. Capacity-sensitive writes use a PostgreSQL advisory transaction lock keyed
   per lodge (`acquireLodgeCapacityLock`), so overlapping booking decisions at
   the same lodge serialise while bookings at different lodges never contend.
   `CONCURRENCY_AND_LOCKING.md` maps the full advisory-lock landscape (all seven
   lock families, which paths take which, and the ordering disciplines).
   Member lifecycle approval (delete / archive) acquires
   `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('member-lifecycle:<memberId>'))` inside
   the transaction. Future approve / reject paths that recount eligibility
   then mutate the member graph should follow the same idiom so a parallel
   write cannot race the re-check.
9. Payment state records an explicit source. Stripe payments stay on Stripe
   PaymentIntent, refund, and recovery paths; Internet Banking payments issue a
   Xero invoice and settle through inbound Xero reconciliation. By default,
   Internet Banking bookings do not hold capacity until reconciliation performs
   the final capacity claim. Admin settings can opt into bed-slot holding for a
   bounded number of days, in which case the booking is `CONFIRMED` while the
   Xero invoice remains unpaid.
10. Bed allocations reconcile when bookings are confirmed, modified, waitlist
   confirmed, force-confirmed, cancelled, completed, or deleted. That reconcile
   auto-fills missing guest nights from active room/bed inventory for the
   reconciled booking **only** (#1686) — it never opportunistically re-plans
   other bookings into idle or freed beds; lodge-wide re-planning is the
   explicit admin "Run auto-allocation" board action. Admins can also manually
   move or approve allocations.

In-progress member self-service edits are limited to future unused nights from
NZ tomorrow onward. NZ today and earlier are locked for admin review through
booking change requests. Positive booking-edit deltas use supplementary Xero
invoices after additional Stripe payment succeeds — carrying signed component
lines (a mixed-sign reduction-plus-fee edit includes its negative price
adjustment) so the invoice and recorded payment equal the net actually charged
(#1356) — while negative deltas use a settlement choice: Stripe refund work
where applicable or an idempotent source-linked member account credit. Both
avoid unsafe financial mutation of a paid, part-paid, credited, or locked
original invoice.

Money values are integer cents. Booking dates are New Zealand date-only lodge
nights rather than timestamps.

## Booking Statuses

Common booking states include:

- `DRAFT` for unconfirmed drafts with a time-to-live
- `PENDING` for non-member hold bookings
- `CONFIRMED` and `PAID` for accepted bookings
- `WAITLISTED` and `WAITLIST_OFFERED` for capacity waitlist flows
- `BUMPED`, `CANCELLED`, and `COMPLETED` for lifecycle transitions

Waitlisted and offered bookings do not consume capacity until confirmed.
Completed bookings continue to consume capacity for their remaining stay nights.
Admins can soft-delete cancelled bookings to hide operational duplicates while
preserving the booking row, audit snapshot, guests, events, and modification
history. Soft-delete remains blocked when captured/refunded/credited payment,
refund, member-credit, payment-recovery, or Xero history exists. Internal
booking modifications do not block this cleanup when their net cent effect is
zero and no external financial or Xero history exists.

## Admin and Lodge

Admin pages cover member management, member CSV import, bookings, operational
booking filters, bed allocation, payments, seasons, policies, refund requests,
promo codes, communications, health, audit logs, reports, Xero operations and
inbound-event drilldowns, committee data, issue reports, waitlist, lodge
operations, hut leaders, and roster/chores. `LodgeSettings` holds each lodge's
operational defaults such as its fallback capacity override and school-group
soft cap; the hut-leader lookahead window used by dashboard and Needs Attention
warnings stays a club-wide knob on the legacy row. Single-lodge clubs keep one
row (ADR-002); additional lodges get their own keyed by lodge id.
The sidebar's Needs Attention Booking Requests badge sums pending internal
booking reviews, requested change requests, and queued public booking requests.
Pending self-service account deletion requests are also counted there and link
admins to the deletion request queue. Unpaid finished stays (#1709/#1731) —
`PAYMENT_PENDING` bookings whose check-out is on or before NZ today — badge an
"Unpaid Finished Stays" entry deep-linking to the pre-filtered bookings list;
its predicate and href live in `src/lib/unpaid-finished-stays.ts`, shared with
the admin dashboard attention card so the two surfaces never drift.
All sidebar badge counts come from the single `GET /api/admin/pending-counts`
endpoint (`src/lib/admin-pending-counts.ts`), whose per-queue where-clauses
mirror the individual queue routes. Sidebar sections render expanded by
default; a per-section collapse preference persists in localStorage.

`src/lib/token-catalogue.ts` is the client-safe single source of truth for the
`{{token}}` placeholders supported in admin HTML content (page bodies and lodge
instructions); the embed/text matching regexes in `src/lib/page-content-embeds.ts`
and the WysiwygEditor token help dialog are both derived from it. Lodge
instruction reader/kiosk routes resolve text tokens on read; the admin editor
route returns them unresolved so edits round-trip.

`src/lib/contextual-help.ts` is the client-safe registry for Admin and Finance
page help popups. `ContextualHelpButton` reads the current route, opens an
accessible dialog from the shell-level help icon, and uses the most specific
matching route entry so nested Admin pages inherit their parent menu help.

Site banners are managed at `/admin/site-banners` (Setup & Configuration).
Admins create plain-text notices with a priority (URGENT/WARNING/NOTIFY) and
an inclusive NZ date-only display window; current active banners render above
the site header on the public, website, and authenticated member shells (not
admin/finance/lodge shells). Visitors can dismiss a banner per browser via
localStorage; editing a banner invalidates prior dismissals. All banner
create/update/delete actions write structured audit logs.

Member CSV import allows distinct identities to share an email address while
preserving the database invariant that only one member per email can have
`canLogin: true`. Duplicate detection uses normalized email plus first and last
name, and setup invites are sent only to imported members that can log in.
Member, dependent, profile, onboarding, and application address forms submit a
`postalSameAsPhysical` flag; route handlers copy physical address fields into
postal fields before persistence when that flag is true.
Address autocomplete is an optional Addy-backed public proxy module. It defaults
off, is gated by Admin Modules and `src/proxy.ts` before route handlers run, and
never replaces manual address entry.

Access roles live in `MemberAccessRole` and are the normalized login/permission
axis. An assignment row carries the legacy enum value (`USER`, `ADMIN`,
`ADMIN_READONLY`, `ADMIN_BOOKINGS`, `ADMIN_MEMBERSHIP`, `ADMIN_CONTENT`,
`LODGE`, `FINANCE_USER`, `FINANCE_ADMIN`, `ORG`) and/or a link to an
`AccessRoleDefinition` row. Definitions are the club-editable roles managed at
`/admin/access-roles`: label, description, and a per-area permission matrix.
The six seeded defaults (Read-only Admin, Booking Officer, Membership
Officer, Content Manager, Finance Viewer, Treasurer) keep their enum value in
`AccessRoleDefinition.systemRole` and can be edited or deleted; brand-new
custom roles are definition-only rows (`role` is NULL). `ADMIN` (Full Admin),
`LODGE`, `USER`, and `ORG` are protected system roles with no definition row:
code-defined, never editable or deletable, and Full Admin always keeps full
permissions.
`Member.role` remains a synchronized compatibility/classification field with
`USER`, `ADMIN`, `LODGE`, `NON_MEMBER`, and `SCHOOL`; Associate, Life, and
club-created categories are membership types, not role enum values.
`Member.financeAccessLevel` remains synchronized for compatibility visibility
(derived from the merged matrix finance level on role writes), but runtime
finance guards ignore it. Non-login records simply have no
access-role rows. The canonical access-role constants and compatibility helpers
live in `src/lib/access-roles.ts`; compatibility role constants stay in
`src/lib/member-roles.ts` for old imports, membership classification, and
provider-created non-member records.

Admin authorization is area-based in `src/lib/admin-permissions.ts`. `ADMIN`
has edit access everywhere (hardcoded, never database-resolved); every other
role resolves per assignment row: a joined `AccessRoleDefinition` is
authoritative, a bare enum value falls back to the legacy hardcoded bundle
(identical to the seeded definitions until the club edits them), and an
unresolved row contributes nothing — the resolver fails closed, never wider.
Roles merge by taking the maximum level per area when assigned together.
Finance-portal access derives from the merged `finance` area level (view ⇒
finance viewer, edit ⇒ finance manager) via `hasFinanceViewerAccess` and
`hasFinanceManagerAccess` in `src/lib/admin-permissions.ts` — Full Admin is
therefore a finance manager, and any role whose matrix grants finance view
(including Read-only Admin, Booking Officer, and Membership Officer as
seeded) can open the finance portal read-only. The member-facing booking
detail route (`/bookings/[id]`) mirrors the admin bookings list gate: any
role with bookings-area view (Booking Officer, Read-only Admin, Full Admin,
and the other seeded booking-capable roles) opens any booking detail
read-only, while every mutation (cancel, pay, modify, notes, delete, and the
Full-Admin-only Admin tools card) stays gated on booking ownership or Full
Admin (issue #1289). `requireAdmin()` infers the
requested admin path and HTTP method from proxy headers and enforces
view/edit requirements centrally, selecting assignment rows with their
definitions joined (`MEMBER_ACCESS_ROLE_SELECT` in
`src/lib/access-role-definitions.ts`); the admin layout precomputes the
matrix server-side and passes it to the sidebar, because definitions cannot
resolve client-side. Member-facing surfaces that gate on `session.user`
(the `/bookings/[id]` detail page and the widened member-facing booking APIs
from #1289/#1313) resolve through the session's embedded
`adminPermissionMatrix` (#1367): `session.user.accessRoles` is enum-only —
definition-backed custom roles carry `role: NULL` and vanish from it — so the
auth `jwt` callback computes the merged matrix from the DB-joined member on
every token refresh and embeds it, and `getAdminPermissionMatrix` treats an
embedded matrix as authoritative (never widened by enum-bundle fallback, so a
club-narrowed seeded definition stays narrowed). Editing a definition applies
to every holder on their next request — `requireAdmin()` and the layouts
re-read roles and definitions from the database, and the session-embedded
matrix is itself recomputed from that same database join per request rather
than trusted from an old token.

The seven areas and what each governs (from `ADMIN_PERMISSION_AREAS`, with the
notable members that live under a broader-sounding prefix called out):

| Area key | Label | Governs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `overview` | Admin Overview | The dashboard and cross-area entry points. The only `/api/admin` route here is the `pending-counts` badge aggregate (the resolver catch-all — see below). |
| `bookings` | Bookings & Beds | Bookings, public booking requests, booking policy, waitlist, and bed allocation — plus seasons, age tiers, and promo codes. |
| `membership` | Membership | Members, applications, family links, memberships, inductions, and communications — plus committee roles/contacts, lockers, and per-member lodge-access. |
| `finance` | Finance | Payments, subscriptions, refunds, reports, Xero sync, and accounting setup — plus the member-prefix carve-outs (member credits and member Xero link/push/unlink). |
| `lodge` | Lodge Operations | Hut leaders, rosters, chores, work parties, lodge settings, and lodges (multi-lodge). The rooms-beds admin *page* is lodge-area, while its bed-allocation *APIs* sit under `bookings`. |
| `content` | Content | Page content, site chrome, banners, public images, and site style. |
| `support` | Support & System | Setup, modules, health, deliverability, audit, issue reports, and operational diagnostics — plus booking-messages and access-role management. |

The six seeded editable roles from `src/lib/access-role-definitions.ts`, plus
the protected Full Admin bundle, resolve to this baseline matrix (`—` = no
access). Definitions are club-editable, so this is the SEEDED starting point,
not a fixed policy; a club may narrow or widen any row except Full Admin:

| Role | overview | bookings | membership | finance | lodge | content | support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full Admin (`ADMIN`, protected) | edit | edit | edit | edit | edit | edit | edit |
| Read-only Admin | view | view | view | view | view | view | view |
| Booking Officer | view | edit | view | view | edit | — | view |

A few route groupings are intentional and adjudicated (issue #1548), not bugs
to "fix" by remapping — any remap silently changes the effective access of every
custom role already deployed: module toggling and booking-messages are system
configuration and sit under `support`; committee records and per-member
lodge-access are member data and sit under `membership`; and `pending-counts` is
the deliberate `overview` catch-all. `src/lib/__tests__/admin-route-area-matrix.test.ts`
pins the full `/api/admin` route → area assignment to a frozen snapshot, so any
prefix edit that moves a route between areas fails CI with a precise diff.

When you add a new admin page (`src/app/(admin)`) or `/api/admin/**` route,
update **both** central route maps: the permission-area map in
`src/lib/admin-permissions.ts` (`ROUTE_AREA_PREFIXES`, or
`SPECIAL_ROUTE_AREA_PATTERNS` when the route needs a different area than its
prefix) so `getAdminRouteRequirement()` gives it the right area/level, and — if
it belongs to an optional module — the feature-gate map
`FEATURE_ROUTE_RULES` in `src/config/feature-routes.ts`. The permission map's
last entry, `overview`, is a catch-all (`/admin`, `/api/admin`): a route that
matches no more specific area silently resolves to `overview`, so a
finance-sensitive route that forgets its prefix would be readable at plain
overview access. `src/lib/__tests__/admin-route-map-drift.test.ts` enforces
this: it enumerates every admin page and `/api/admin` route and fails the build
if one lands on the overview catch-all without an intentional entry in that
test's small, justified `OVERVIEW_ALLOWLIST`. The guard catches *unmapped*
routes; it cannot catch a route *mis-mapped* by inheriting an existing wrong
prefix, so still add a `SPECIAL_ROUTE_AREA_PATTERNS` entry by hand when a
sensitive action lands under a broader prefix. New optional-module surfaces at
brand-new prefixes must be added to `FEATURE_ROUTE_RULES` by hand — the guard
only verifies existing feature prefixes still point at real files.

Managing the definitions themselves is Full-Admin-only: the
`/api/admin/access-roles` mutation handlers enforce an explicit `isFullAdmin`
check on top of `requireAdmin()` (an editable role could otherwise widen
itself past the area gate), deletion is blocked while any member holds the
role (including via a bare enum row), and create/update/delete write
critical-severity audit entries.

Access-role writes carry an additional separation-of-duties gate, independent
of the path-inferred area: only a Full Admin (`ADMIN`) may grant or revoke
privileged access roles (every role other than `USER` and `ORG` — custom
definition-backed roles are always privileged), including via the legacy
`Member.role` and `financeAccessLevel` compatibility fields and the
member-import `role` column. Role writes are token-based: the enum value for
system roles and seeded defaults, the definition id for custom roles. The shared helpers are `isFullAdmin` and
`accessRoleChangeRequiresFullAdmin` in `src/lib/access-roles.ts`; the member
editor, create, bulk-update, and import paths all apply them and return 403
for a non-Full-Admin actor. `requireAdmin()` returns DB-verified access roles
on the session user so these checks never trust a stale JWT claim. A
submission that changes no role field — such as the member editor echoing a
member's unchanged roles back on a contact-only edit — is not a role write:
it neither requires Full Admin nor rewrites a dormant privileged legacy role
still stored on a non-login (archived or cancelled) member. The same
boundary covers the login email: only a Full Admin may change the email of
another member who holds a privileged access role, because an email change
plus a forgot-password request would hand the account and its roles to the
new address (`hasPrivilegedAccess` in `src/lib/access-roles.ts`).

Two further guards protect the admin population itself against being locked
out (issue #1604, extended to three more verbs by #1622), enforced server-side
across every path that can deactivate, disable login for, or archive an existing
account — member edit, bulk update, member lifecycle archive, deletion-request
approval, membership-cancellation approval, family-group login-holder
transfer (`POST /api/admin/family-groups/[id]/login-holder`), and dependent
linking with `disableLogin` (`POST /api/admin/members/[id]/dependents/link`).
The **last-admin guard** blocks any actor, including another Full Admin, from removing the final
active, login-enabled Full Admin; a bulk deactivate is evaluated on its end
state so a selection that collectively removes every remaining Full Admin fails
as a whole. The login-holder transfer both revokes and grants `canLogin` in one
operation, so it evaluates the end state as a raw count of active Full Admins on
its post-write read view (`countActiveFullAdmins` inside the transaction) rather
than the exclude-based helpers — the incoming holder's grant is thereby counted.
The **privileged-target guard** restricts deactivating, de-logging, or
archiving an account that holds — or dormantly stores — a privileged role to
Full Admins only, matching the #1012 role gate and so a scoped admin such as
the seeded Membership Officer can no longer touch admin-holding accounts. A
"Full Admin" here is exactly what `requireAdmin()` grants on: an active,
login-enabled member with the `ADMIN` access-role row (a legacy `Member.role =
ADMIN` without that row is not counted, because it confers no runtime admin
access). The helpers live in `src/lib/admin-account-guards.ts`
(`wouldRemoveLastFullAdmin`, `wouldRemoveAllFullAdmins`, `countActiveFullAdmins`,
`actorIsFullAdmin`) and `memberHoldsPrivilegedRole` in
`src/lib/access-roles.ts`; the last-admin count runs inside each path's mutation
transaction so it sees that transaction's read view. Two concurrent
deactivations of the last two admins remain a narrow residual TOCTOU on the
paths without an advisory lock, acceptable at club scale. The guarantee is
closed-world over de-logins of existing accounts: every other `canLogin` writer
in the codebase either creates a brand-new member (booking-request, school,
group-booking, and Xero-import contacts; nomination and family-request
dependants; admin member-create and CSV member-import rows, whose `canLogin`
value only seeds the new row) or passes `canLogin` as a read/token filter
(`normalizeAssignableAccessRoleTokens`, list/where clauses), and so cannot
strand an existing admin. The one remaining flow
outside these seven paths that can clear `canLogin` on an existing admin and is
not guarded is indirect: the age-down cron via a date-of-birth edit into a minor
tier.

Seasonal membership types are policy records, not access roles. `MembershipType`
stores the stable identifier, display text, active/archive state, sort order,
booking behavior, subscription behavior, allowed age tiers, and optional Xero
contact-group rules for built-in and admin-defined types. The admin settings
page presents types as an ordered policy list; create/edit opens a dedicated
editor for identity, behavior, allowed tiers, and Xero rule configuration, while
seasonal assignment roll-forward sits in its own preview/run section. The
built-ins are Full, Associate, Life, School, Non-Member, and Family; Associate
is the single Associate/Reserve-style built-in and can be renamed by the club.
Create and rename requests that would duplicate another type's display name
(case-insensitive exact match) are rejected with a 409. Age tiers stay separate
because the same tier can appear under several membership types. Age Tier Xero
groups are for broad age cohorts, Membership Type Xero groups are for status or
policy labels, and clubs can configure both when Xero needs both labels.
`SeasonalMembershipAssignment` records a member's type for a membership
`seasonYear`, assignment source, and optional date-only `applyFrom` changeover.
The initial backfill maps existing legacy roles to current-season assignments.
Admin changes to an individual member's seasonal type go through a preview that
reports affected future confirmed bookings, draft bookings, waitlist records,
current subscription state, and recent subscription history, then require an
admin reason before the audited save. The membership-type settings page can roll
assignments forward from one season to another idempotently, skipping existing
target-season assignments and reporting missing or inactive-type exceptions.
The Admin > Members list shows the current seasonal Membership Type beside the
Access column so operators can scan access and membership policy separately.
When Xero is connected, the Xero contact-group badges and filters on that page
are served from a local cache; a "Refresh Xero Groups" action repopulates it and
a contextual hint next to the button reports when the cache was last refreshed
(or prompts the operator to populate it when it has never been refreshed).
Booking pricing and booking gates resolve the member's effective seasonal type
for the booking season:
`MEMBER_RATE` uses normal member rates, `NON_MEMBER_RATE` uses non-member
nightly rates while preserving member identity, and `BLOCK_BOOKING` returns a
structured policy error before the booking is created or repriced. Subscription
displays and booking lockout also resolve the seasonal type: `NOT_REQUIRED` is
an effective status layered over the raw `MemberSubscription`/Xero history,
which remains stored and visible for audit. Seasonal type changes do not
automatically reprice existing future bookings. Committee assignments remain
separate public/contact metadata. `CommitteeRole` stores reusable master positions
and their role email aliases, and `CommitteeAssignment` links members to those
positions with blurb, sort order, published, show-phone, contactable, and active
flags. The public committee API reads only active, published assignments with
active roles, never selects member email, returns phone only when show-phone is
enabled, and exposes contact keys only for contactable assignments. The contact
form resolves those assignment keys server-side to the role email alias, then to
the linked member's email when the role email is blank, and finally to the club
contact address when no recipient email is available. Committee contact email
delivery stores an opaque committee-contact marker in EmailLog instead of the
recipient address.

Membership cancellation is a member-initiated account lifecycle workflow.
Requests can include the requester, dependants, non-login adults, and related
family adults. Login-capable adults receive their own confirmation link before
admin review. Admin approval disables the local membership, clears operational
family/email-inheritance links, preserves financial and lodge history, and
queues Xero cancellation operations.

Cancelled members can be archived through `MemberLifecycleActionRequest` with
the `ARCHIVE` action. Archive requires a reason and approval by a different
admin through the `/admin/membership-cancellations` review queue. Approval keeps
the member record and related history but marks it archived, inactive, and
non-login so default operational lists exclude it.

Member records created in error use `MemberLifecycleActionRequest` with the
`DELETE` action. A delete request requires a reason, approval by a different
admin, a clean eligibility check with no booking, financial, family, Xero, or
membership history blockers, and a retained member snapshot before hard
deletion. Direct `DELETE /api/admin/members/[id]` is intentionally disabled.

The lodge kiosk has its own PIN session model and permission tiers for
view-only, guest, hut-leader, and admin-style lodge actions. It supports guest
arrival/departure, expected arrival times, chores, and issue reporting without
exposing the full admin interface.

## Integrations

### Stripe

Stripe is used for PaymentIntents, SetupIntents, saved payment methods, refunds,
and webhook reconciliation. Webhook routes should be idempotent and must not
trust client-supplied payment state. Internet Banking payments are explicitly
excluded from Stripe-only PaymentIntent, refund, and recovery paths.

Superseded Stripe PaymentIntents that can no longer settle a booking are tracked
through `PaymentRecoveryOperation`. The recovery worker cancels still-open
intents, treats already-cancelled intents as complete, and queues/refunds late
captures without running the normal booking-confirmation path.

Refund recovery is exactly-once across multi-transaction payments (#1097): a
failed refund reports how much was refunded-and-recorded so the recovery row
is enqueued for only the remainder, and the worker freezes its
per-transaction allocation on the row (`allocationPlan`) before the first
Stripe call. Retries replay those exact slices with their original
idempotency keys — Stripe answers repeats with the original refund and the
`PaymentRefund` ledger dedupes by refund id — instead of re-deriving a
shifted allocation from whatever progress happens to be recorded. The
booking-cancellation (#1349) and refund-request (#1510) inline paths go
further and freeze the exact slices they execute on the row at **enqueue**
time — before any Stripe call — passing one frozen plan to both the inline
refund and the recovery enqueue, so a multi-transaction partial-progress
replay re-requests byte-identical slices under identical keys rather than a
re-derived allocation. A refund-request row enqueued before #1510 carries no
frozen plan and derives-at-replay (unchanged; post-#1507 single-transaction
payments — the dominant case — already share slice keys). The
recovery row also carries the originating route's Stripe key prefix
(`stripeKeyPrefix`, #1152), so even a refund that succeeded on Stripe but was
never recorded locally is replayed under its original keys rather than
re-minted — the same guarantee refund-request recoveries have had since
#1039. The replay also sends a **byte-identical request body** (#1507, the
refund-request and booking-modification counterpart of the booking-cancellation
convergence #1494): the cron rebuilds the Stripe metadata from the same shared
helpers the inline paths use (`buildRefundRequestRefundMetadata`; and for
modification refunds `buildBookingModificationRefundMetadata`, whose per-path
`reason` is reconstructed from the persisted key prefix), so a reused idempotency
key replays the original refund instead of being rejected as an
`idempotency_error` for mismatched parameters.

Additional PaymentIntent creation has the same durable safety net (#1096):
every price-increasing edit path (batch modify, date change, guest add,
single-guest removal) creates the intent through one shared settlement
helper, and a transient Stripe failure enqueues a
`CREATE_ADDITIONAL_PAYMENT_INTENT` recovery operation keyed to the booking
modification. The worker re-creates the intent with the original
modification-scoped Stripe idempotency key (so route and cron can never
double-mint), skips itself if a later edit already minted a newer additional
intent, and points any supplementary Xero invoice operation still waiting on
the failed intent at the recovered one.

Group-settlement PaymentIntents get the same safety net: switching a group
settlement to Internet Banking or re-attempting a card settlement voids the
superseded intent in Stripe, and if a stale intent still captures, the webhook
handler refunds it in full (with a deterministic idempotency key) and alerts
admins instead of settling anything.

### Operational Xero

Operational Xero handles member/contact sync, booking invoices, payments,
credit notes, item codes, contact groups, inbound webhooks, local caches, retry
queues, and usage metering. Xero tokens are encrypted at rest.
OAuth token refresh uses a short database-backed lease on the operational
token row so multiple app workers cannot use the same rotating refresh token.
Internet Banking bookings use this boundary to issue invoice-backed payment
instructions and reconcile settlement from inbound Xero invoice/payment state.
Unheld Internet Banking reconciliation performs the final capacity claim before
marking a booking paid. If the paid booking no longer fits, the payment is
recorded as succeeded, the booking is cancelled, member account credit is
created for the paid amount, Xero account-credit work is queued, admins are
alerted, and waitlists are processed. Held Internet Banking bookings are
released by the payment cron when their hold expiry passes unpaid; the release
cancels the booking, fails the pending payment, queues invoice-clearing
credit-note work, emails the member, records history/audit, and processes
waitlists.

### Finance reporting

Finance reporting uses the same operational Xero connection that booking,
payment, and membership flows use. The finance sync service reads reports,
invoice datasets, bank balances, and chart-of-accounts snapshots through that
connection, then stores `FinanceSnapshot` and `FinanceSyncRun` rows for page
rendering. There is no separate finance Xero OAuth app, token store, callback
route, or usage-metering table.

### Address autocomplete

Address autocomplete uses server-side Addy credentials only in
`src/lib/addy-api.ts`. Browser code talks to `/api/address-autocomplete/**`,
which is feature-gated by the `addressAutocomplete` Admin Module and rate
limited. Missing credentials and upstream failures return small error payloads;
address forms keep manual inputs editable so saving an address does not depend
on Addy availability.

### Email

AWS SES SMTP sends transactional email. SES SNS feedback is ingested for bounce
and complaint suppression. Email templates should avoid embedding secrets and
should use effective recipient logic for dependents where required. Editable
templates and admin/system delivery policies are registered in the email
message registry and surfaced in Admin Setup and Admin Notifications.
If an admin/system alert cannot be delivered to any opted-in admin recipient
because every send is suppressed or fails, the app records a critical
communication audit event and surfaces it in Admin Email Deliverability.
Failed token-bearing lifecycle emails for nomination requests, member setup
invites, and membership cancellation confirmations are not auto-retried because
their HTML is redacted; Admin Email Deliverability exposes a reissue action that
creates a fresh token and resends the lifecycle email after any active
suppression has been cleared.
Nomination request links also have workflow-level recovery: expired unconfirmed
links are renewed by the `nomination-reminders` cron weekly for four automatic
reminders, and admins can refresh or replace unconfirmed nominators from the
member-applications queue.
Membership cancellation, archive, and hard-delete lifecycle messages use that
registry so operators can preview and override copy without bypassing the
shared `sendEmail` path.

## Cron Jobs

Cron jobs run inside the `app` cron-leader container. Web-only blue/green slots
disable cron with `CRON_ENABLED=false`.

Third phase (#1236): resumes a crash-interrupted organiser-cancel cleanup (ORGANISER_PAYS group still not CANCELLED under a CANCELLED organiser booking, older than `GROUP_CANCEL_RESUME_GRACE_MINUTES`, default 15m), re-driving the idempotent joiner cleanup — its persisted refund plan reconstructs the per-child refund mirror rather than recomputing |

### Failure observability (audit gap G5 — partially closed by design)

Cron and webhook FAILURE paths bridge their `logger.error`/`logger.fatal` catch
handlers to Sentry through `reportCronError`/`reportWebhookError` in
`src/lib/observability-bridge.ts`, which log via the pino singleton **and**
forward to Sentry with a stable `fingerprint`. This is a scoped report-helper,
not a global pino transport: ordinary route/request loggers never import the
bridge and stay log-only, so a noisy request path cannot cause alert fatigue —
the objection #1150 raised against a global bridge. The boundary is deliberate:
top-level cron catch handlers (including the general cron runner's per-task
failures) and top-level webhook catch handlers (Stripe, Xero, SES/SNS) are
bridged, while best-effort per-item failures inside those jobs (e.g. a single
joiner email that will be retried, waitlist item failures) stay log-only to
preserve signal-to-noise. An in-process cooldown
(`OBSERVABILITY_SENTRY_DEDUP_COOLDOWN_MS`, default 5 minutes) keyed by the
fingerprint stops a stuck cron/webhook from emitting one Sentry event per tick;
the Sentry fingerprint dedups grouping across processes. Cross-instance
exact-once alerting remains future work (#1211), and which fingerprints page
whom is operator-side Sentry alert-rule configuration.

### Auth-bounce diagnostics (#1669)

When the `(authenticated)` or `(admin)` layout guard is about to redirect to
`/login` because the wrapped `auth()` returned null, `recordAuthBounce()` in
`src/lib/auth-diagnostics.ts` classifies why before the redirect:

- **`no-cookie`** — normal anonymous visit: a `debug`-level pino line only.
  No `AuditLog` row, no Sentry event, no reference code.
- **`session-invalidated`** — the session decoded but the password-change
  revocation gate nulled it: pino `info` plus a durable `AuditLog` row
  (`action=auth.bounce`, `category=auth`, retention
  `diagnostic_high_volume`) capturing `memberId`, session issuance, the
  revoking change time, and their delta. No Sentry.
- **`cookie-present-no-session`** — a session cookie was sent but no server
  session emerged (the real anomaly): pino `warn`, the `AuditLog` row, and
  **one** Sentry event deduped by an in-process cooldown (same
  `OBSERVABILITY_SENTRY_DEDUP_COOLDOWN_MS` knob) under the stable
  fingerprint `["auth-bounce", "cookie-present-no-session"]`.

The Sentry path is deliberately **not** part of `observability-bridge.ts` —
that bridge's contract stays cron/webhook-only; this is a second provably
scoped emitter with exactly one fingerprint. Durable bounces mint a random
8-hex reference code, appended to the login URL as `ref` and shown on the
login page ("Trouble signing in? Reference: …"); the `AuditLog` row is keyed
by it via `requestId`. Token values and raw cookie contents are never read
into any sink (only cookie-name matches, chunk counts, and byte lengths),
the durable record carries `memberId` rather than an email address, and the
whole path is exception-guarded so a logging/DB failure can never turn the
307 redirect into a 500. The audit write runs post-response via `after()`
and is capped per process-minute (`AUTH_BOUNCE_AUDIT_MAX_WRITES_PER_MINUTE`,
default 10) so an unauthenticated junk cookie cannot be spammed into
unbounded `AuditLog` inserts — suppressed rows are tallied onto the next
written row's `suppressedSinceLastWrite`, and the pino line stays
unthrottled so raw bounce volume remains visible in logs. Note for
operators: rotating `AUTH_SECRET` turns every live session cookie into a
`cookie-present-no-session` bounce until those cookies expire (≤8h) — a
row-per-bounce burst in the audit trail and at most one Sentry event per
cooldown per container is expected then, not a regression.

## Security and Privacy Boundaries

- Auth uses credentials sessions with explicit admin, admin-area, and finance
  guards.
- Finance access is separate from general admin access; `FINANCE_ADMIN` also
  grants Treasurer edit access to finance admin routes.
- Public bearer tokens are stored hashed or encrypted according to use case.
- Logs, Sentry events, and webhook records should be redacted before storing or
  emitting sensitive values.
- Mutation routes should validate inputs with structured schemas and enforce
  role/session checks close to the route boundary.
- External service callbacks and webhooks must verify signatures, state, or
  expected origin data before mutating local state.
- Google Analytics is optional and privacy-gated: the Analytics module,
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`, and a visitor opt-in are all required before
  GA4 loads on public website or public account pages.

## Deployment and Migrations

Production deployment uses the blue/green runner documented in `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
Database migrations must follow `docs/BLUE_GREEN_MIGRATION_POLICY.md` so old
and new app versions can overlap safely during cutover.

Staging and accessibility checks use `docker-compose.staging.yml`,
`Caddyfile.staging`, `.env.staging.example`, and the workflow in
`docs/STAGING_ACCESSIBILITY.md`.

## Configuration

The environment contract is documented in `.env.example` and
`.env.staging.example`. Use test or demo service credentials outside production.
Do not commit real `.env`, database dumps, generated reports, logs, or build
artifacts.
