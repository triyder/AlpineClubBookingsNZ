# Documentation Style Guide

This guide defines how documentation is written and organised in this
repository. It is the foundation the operator-guide programme (issue #2050)
builds on: every new guide follows the skeleton and conventions below so the
docs read as one coherent, best-in-class set rather than a pile of pages.

`AGENTS.md` ("Change Discipline" → docs lockstep) makes following this guide a
requirement whenever documentation is added or changed. Read it here first.

## Audience labels

Every document targets one or more of four audiences. State the audience near
the top of the page (a short "Audience:" line, or make it obvious from a hub
section heading). The four labels are:

| Label | Who they are | What they need |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Adopter** | Someone evaluating or forking the platform for their own club. | Product scope, setup, configuration, what to change for their club, deployment. |
| **Operator** | An admin/committee member running a live club day to day. | Task-focused "how do I do X" guides with screenshots, settings references, troubleshooting. |
| **Developer** | Someone changing the code. | Architecture, module boundaries, domain invariants, state machines, test/CI contracts. |
| **Agent** | An automated coding agent (Claude Code, Codex). | The agent contract, workflow, review severity, prompt-injection handling. |

A page may serve more than one audience (for example `ARCHITECTURE.md` serves
developers and adopters). List every audience it genuinely serves; do not
label a deep-internals doc "operator" to look approachable.

## Plain-English first, WITH technical detail — never either/or

Lead every section with a plain-English sentence a non-technical operator can
follow, THEN give the precise technical detail (file paths, env vars, exact
flag names, `code`) alongside it. This is not a choice between two versions of
a doc; both live in the same paragraph or in adjacent plain-then-precise
sentences. An operator should be able to act from the plain text; a developer
should find the exact contract in the same place without opening the code.

- Good: "Turn on the waitlist so members can queue for full nights (Admin →
  Setup → Modules, the `waitlist` module). It gates `/admin/waitlist` and the
  force-confirm actions."
- Avoid: a plain paragraph that never names the toggle, or a wall of
  `snake_case` with no sentence explaining what it does for the club.

Keep money in integer cents and dates as NZ date-only lodge nights in every
example, matching the domain rules in `DOMAIN_INVARIANTS.md`.

## Where operator guides live (pinned)

All operator guides live in **`docs/guides/`**, one Markdown file per admin
area, named after the route (`docs/guides/bookings.md` for `/admin/bookings`,
`docs/guides/bed-allocation.md` for `/admin/bed-allocation`). This is fixed so
every relative path in a guide is predictable:

- Screenshots (under `docs/images/**`) are referenced as `../images/<area>/…`.
- The hub back-link (to `docs/README.md`) is `../README.md`.
- A feature-hub back-link (e.g. to `docs/multi-lodge/README.md`) is
  `../multi-lodge/README.md`.

The copy-paste template below already uses these paths; keep new guides in
`docs/guides/` so they stay correct. `COVERAGE_MATRIX.md` names the same
location, and #2050 agents must place guides there.

Member guides live in **`docs/user-guide/`** and are additionally
**auto-mirrored to the GitHub wiki** (`scripts/sync-user-guide-wiki.mjs`, run
by the `Wiki sync` workflow on every push to `main`; locally, clone the wiki
repo and run `npm run docs:wiki-sync -- --out <wiki-clone-dir>`). The folder
is the single source of truth: the mirror rewrites relative links to absolute
repo URLs, stamps every page with a mirrored-do-not-edit banner, and deletes
orphaned mirrored pages. Never edit the wiki directly, and never link to
*individual* wiki pages from in-repo docs — page names are rename-fragile and
the CI link check cannot see them (the wiki's stable **root URL** is the one
allowed exception). Because the mirror rewrites anything link-shaped,
user-guide pages must not put link-shaped text (`[x](y)`) inside code fences
or backticks.

## Operator-guide page skeleton (required)

Every operator guide (the pages #2050 produces, one per admin area, under
`docs/guides/`) uses this exact section order. Omit a section only when it
genuinely does not apply, and say so rather than silently dropping it.

1. **What it is** — one or two plain sentences: what this feature/area does for
   the club, and the admin path to reach it (`Admin → …`) plus the route
   (`/admin/<area>`).
2. **When you'd use it** — the real situations that send an operator here.
3. **Step-by-step** — numbered tasks, each with the click path and an inline
   **screenshot** (see conventions below) at the step that needs it.
4. **Settings reference** — a table of every setting/field on the page: name,
   what it controls in plain English, default, and any constraint (e.g. "integer
   cents", "NZ date-only", "requires the `xeroIntegration` module").
5. **Troubleshooting** — symptom → cause → fix, for the failure modes operators
   actually hit. Link to the relevant runbook when recovery is involved.
6. **Related links** — back-link to the hub (`docs/README.md` and/or a feature
   hub), plus sibling guides and the reference/architecture docs that own the
   deeper contract.

A copy-paste template is at the end of this file.

## Screenshot conventions

Screenshots keep operator guides usable. They are produced by the automated
capture harness, never hand-cropped ad hoc, so they stay consistent and
re-creatable.

- **Location:** all images live under `docs/images/**`, grouped by area
  (`docs/images/admin/`, `docs/images/public/`, and `docs/images/readme/` for
  the repository front-page assets). Never store screenshots elsewhere or
  inline them as data URIs.
- **Harness:** `e2e/tools/capture-screenshots.ts` (run via `npm run
  docs:screenshots`) captures a **named** set against the seeded staging app.
  Filenames are stable and defined in the harness manifest, so re-running
  overwrites the same file — a screenshot refresh is a diff, not a rename.
- **README assets (same rules, own harnesses):** the root README's hero banner
  and social-preview image are generated by `npm run docs:readme-art`
  (`e2e/tools/compose-readme-art.ts`, deterministic SVG composition — edit the
  script, never the PNGs), and its booking-flow demo GIF by `npm run
  docs:demo-gif` (`e2e/tools/capture-demo-gif.ts`) against the same seeded
  staging stack. The GIF walk stops on the review step so it never creates a
  booking, must only ever show demo-seed data, and stays under 5&nbsp;MB (the
  harness enforces this).
- **Naming:** `<area>-<page-or-state>.png`, lower-kebab-case, matching the
  harness manifest key (e.g. `admin-dashboard.png`, `admin-bed-allocation.png`,
  `public-home.png`). Do not add spaces, capitals, or timestamps.
- **Viewport / determinism:** the harness uses a fixed 1280×800 desktop
  viewport and the deterministic demo seed so captures are stable across runs.
  Capture full-page where the page scrolls.
- **Size:** prefer PNG; keep individual images reasonable (the 1280-wide
  full-page PNGs the harness emits are fine). Do not commit multi-megabyte
  raw captures.
- **Alt text (required):** every embedded image has descriptive alt text that
  states what the screenshot shows, e.g. from a guide in `docs/guides/`:
  `![Admin dashboard showing the Needs Attention cards](../images/admin/admin-dashboard.png)`.
  Alt text is not decorative filler — a screen-reader user must learn what the
  image conveys. The blessed form is `<Page> showing <what it conveys>`; do not
  mass-rewrite existing alt text that already names the page and what it shows.
- **Ordering (link check):** a screenshot must be captured and committed *before
  or in the same change as* the guide that references it — the CI link check
  (lychee, offline) fails on a guide that points at an image file that does not
  yet exist on disk. Never merge a guide ahead of its images.
- **Refresh policy:** when a page's UI changes materially, re-run the harness in
  the same PR and commit the updated image (same filename). Treat a stale
  screenshot like stale prose: fix it in lockstep. If the harness gains a new
  named page, add its manifest entry and reference it from the guide in the same
  change.
- **Privacy:** capture only against the demo/seeded data set. Never commit a
  screenshot containing real member, payment, or accounting data
  (`CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- **Capture only what your change documents:** run the harness with explicit
  capture names (`npx tsx e2e/tools/capture-screenshots.ts <name...>`), never
  the whole manifest — a full run commits images for pages other batches/PRs
  own, stranding orphan PNGs that their real PR then has to re-refresh.
- **Screenshot density:** one screenshot per capturable distinct route or tab
  (a guide covering six sub-pages embeds six captures). Client-side wizard or
  dialog sub-steps the URL-driven harness cannot reach are described in prose —
  they need no screenshot. Do not ship a single landing shot for a
  multi-screen area.
- **Session settle:** authenticated admin pages gate edit affordances on the
  client session hook (`useAdminAreaEditAccess`). It is tri-state (#2065): it
  reports `undefined` while the post-hydration session fetch is still resolving,
  and every consumer renders a NEUTRAL state for that window — controls disabled
  (never flashing enabled for a would-be view-only admin) and NO "view only"
  banner or read-only editor caption (never flashing the banner for a would-be
  editor). The harness still waits for the fetch to settle before shooting, as
  belt-and-braces, so captures show the fully-resolved state. If you add a new
  kind of late-settling UI, extend the harness settle logic generically — never
  paper over it per-capture.
- **Describing view-only access in prose:** since #2160 a view-only admin
  usually meets ONE section banner — "You have view-only access to this area" —
  at the top of the section, and the buttons below it are simply disabled and
  carry no explanation of their own. Write guides to match: point the reader at
  the banner, and do NOT tell them to hover a greyed-out button for a tooltip.
  That tooltip never appears (disabled buttons receive no pointer events), and
  gated controls also stay out of the keyboard tab order, so "tab to the button
  to hear why" is wrong too. **Check the screen before you write "the banner
  says why":** 53 controls still carry their own per-button reason instead —
  controls inside a dialog, popover, or dropdown; leaf toolbars dropped into
  another page's layout; and, most of all, the **member detail per-record cards**
  (`/admin/members/[id]`), which are unconverted pending owner decision #2168.
  See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full list of shapes and counts. And note
  the banner is stated once per **section**, not once per screen: a page built
  from several banner-bearing sections repeats it once per section, so
  `/admin/security` and `/admin/booking-requests` each show it three times. What
  is ruled out is *nesting* — a banner-bearing component never renders another
  one, so no admin meets the sentence twice over the same controls. So on a
  multi-section page, write "each section says so at the top", not "the page
  says so once at the top". Whether stacked sibling banners should collapse into
  a single page-level one is an open design question, and is exactly what owner
  decision #2168 is deciding for the member detail page.

## Guide opening line (canonical)

The "What it is" section opens with the canonical location line:

> Find it at **Admin → <nav path>** (`/admin/<route>`).

For a page that has **no direct sidebar entry** but is reached by a real click
path through a hub, **hub-path-first is canonical**: give the full click path
including the hub, then say how to open it —

> Find it at **Admin → <full click path incl. hub>** (`/admin/<route>`). It has
> no direct sidebar entry — open it from the **<X>** card.

Route-first (leading with `/admin/<route>`) is reserved ONLY for pages with no
click path at all — lodge-scoped pages that require picking a lodge first (e.g.
lockers, seasons), where there is no clean `Admin → X` path. Even then, say
explicitly how the page is reached. Do not copy a justified exception as the
template.

## Linking rules

The docs form a navigable graph, not a flat folder. Two invariants:

1. **Every doc is reachable from a hub.** A new doc must be linked from
   `docs/README.md` (the top audience-first hub) directly, or from a feature hub
   (a `README.md` inside a feature subdirectory such as `finance-dashboard/`,
   `multi-lodge/`, `lobby-display/`, `xero/`) that is itself linked from
   `docs/README.md`. No orphan pages.
2. **Every hub back-links.** A feature hub links back up to `docs/README.md` (a
   short "Part of the [documentation hub](../README.md)" line), and every
   operator guide's "Related links" points back to its hub. Navigation works in
   both directions.

Other linking rules:

- Use **relative** links between docs (`../DEPLOYMENT.md`, `xero/ARCHITECTURE.md`),
  never absolute file paths or bare filenames that hide which directory the
  target lives in. A file at the repo root referenced from `docs/` is
  `../NAME.md`.
- Prefer linking a `[`code-named`](path)` reference over a bare code span when
  you name another doc, so the link checker can verify it.
- In a guide's **Related links**, label the sibling list `Sibling guides:`. Add
  a qualifier (e.g. `Sibling monitoring guides:`) only when a hub genuinely
  groups several distinct sibling sets and the label needs to name which one.
- Run `npm run docs:linkcheck` before pushing; CI runs the same class of check
  (`.github/workflows/docs-link-check.yml`, lychee in offline mode).

## Mermaid conventions

Diagrams are authored in [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) fenced code blocks
(` ```mermaid `) so they render on GitHub and stay diff-able in text. They are
hand-curated to reflect the real code — never machine-generated from an import
scan, which produces noise instead of the meaningful module boundaries a reader
needs (owner decision, #2049).

- Use `flowchart TD`/`LR` for structure and dependency/module-boundary
  diagrams, `sequenceDiagram` for request/data flows, and `erDiagram` only for
  small focused data slices (the full schema stays in `prisma/schema.prisma`).
- Keep each diagram to one idea. Prefer several small diagrams over one giant
  one.
- Label edges with the relationship ("queues", "reads", "webhook") rather than
  leaving bare arrows.
- Quote node labels containing spaces or punctuation (`A["Next.js app"]`) so the
  parser does not choke.
- Verify a diagram parses before committing: `npx @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli -i
  file.md -o /tmp/out.svg` (or paste into the mermaid live editor). Note in the
  PR how you validated.
- A diagram must match the code. When the code moves, update the diagram in the
  same PR — the same lockstep rule as screenshots.
