# Email Message Audit

This is an audit of outbound email messages in the current repository state.
The main sender is `src/lib/email.ts`; most HTML bodies are in
`src/lib/email-templates.ts`. Direct one-off senders also exist in the contact
route, refund appeal admin route, admin bulk communications route, and email
retry cron.

This audit covers mail sent by this repository through its Nodemailer/SES path.
I did not find a repo path that instructs Xero to email invoices; any Xero-side
invoice email would be outside this repo's sender inventory.

The `/admin/setup` and `/admin/notifications` interfaces expose email message
settings so administrators can edit shared email variables and template wording
without changing TypeScript files. Admin/system notification delivery policies
are managed from `/admin/notifications`.

Sensitive tokens (`{{doorCode}}`, `{{token}}`, `{{pin}}`, `{{resetUrl}}`,
`{{verifyUrl}}`, `{{confirmationUrl}}`) are body-only: subjects are persisted
in `EmailLog` for every template and travel in clear mail headers, so template
override subjects containing these tokens are rejected at save time, and the
renderer never substitutes their values into a subject line. Required tokens
must appear in the template body; a token in the subject does not satisfy the
requirement.

## Runtime Placeholders

The public checkout has no `config/club.json`, so the checked-in fallback values
come from `config/club.example.json`.

- `{{CLUB_NAME}}`: `Example Mountain Club` in this checkout.
- `{{CLUB_BOOKINGS_NAME}}`: `Example Mountain Club - Bookings` in this checkout.
- `{{CLUB_LODGE_NAME}}`: `Example Mountain Club Lodge` in this checkout.
- `{{CLUB_EMAIL_FROM_NAME}}`: `Example Mountain Club - Online Booking System`
  in this checkout.
- `{{SUPPORT_EMAIL}}`: `support@example.org` in this checkout unless overridden
  by `SUPPORT_EMAIL`.
- `{{CONTACT_EMAIL}}`: `bookings@example.org` in this checkout unless overridden
  by `CONTACT_EMAIL`.
- `{{BASE_URL}}`: `NEXTAUTH_URL` origin at runtime, or `http://localhost:3000`.
- `{{CLUB_LODGE_TRAVEL_NOTE}}`: `The lodge is located near the mountain. Please allow adequate travel time.`

## Common Email Frame

All messages built with `layout()` have this visible frame around the body:

```text
{{CLUB_EMAIL_FROM_NAME}}

Online Booking System

...message body...

{{CLUB_NAME}} • Online Booking System
{{BASE_URL without protocol}}
```

The contact form and permanent email-failure alert do not use this branded
frame.

Admin alert emails are sent once per active admin whose admin notification
preference allows that alert type. They are sent as separate emails, not one
BCC. SES bounce/complaint suppression can skip a recipient before SMTP send.

Failed non-sensitive emails with retained HTML are retried every 30 minutes,
with a 15 minute backoff and at most 3 attempts. Token-bearing templates are not
auto-retried because their HTML is deliberately not retained.

## Exact Messages

### password-reset

Once you set your password, you can log in at any time to book stays, view your bookings, and manage your profile.

If you have any questions, contact the club at {{SUPPORT_EMAIL}}.
```

Triggers and frequency:

- Age-up cron, scheduled daily at 6:30 AM NZST.
- Candidate criteria: active member, cannot login yet, age tier is not ADULT, date of birth places them in the configured ADULT age tier at the season start date.
- Requires the member to have a unique login email and no email-inheritance source.
- Skips if a sent/queued `age-up-invitation` already exists for the member email.

Email Address Needed for {{memberName}}

Hi {{recipientName}},

{{memberName}} has reached the {{targetAgeTierLabel}} age tier. Before we can activate their own booking login, they need a unique email address on their member record.

They are currently using or inheriting another member's login email, so we have not enabled their login yet.

Please contact the club at {{SUPPORT_EMAIL}} with {{memberName}}'s preferred email address. Once it is updated, their booking login can be activated.
```

Triggers and frequency:

- Age-up cron, scheduled daily at 6:30 AM NZST.

- Does not include a token or login setup link.
- Leaves the ageing-up member unchanged: no login enablement, no setup token, and no age-tier update.
