# Staging And Accessibility Verification

This is the non-production target for accessibility and other browser
verification. Use it whenever a release review or manual QA step should not run
against production.

## Target

Default local staging origin:

```text
http://localhost:3001
```

For shared staging, set `NEXTAUTH_URL` in `.env.staging` to the exact HTTPS
origin users will open, for example:

```text
https://staging.example.org
```

Record the actual origin used in the issue or PR that requested verification.
Do not infer a staging host from production DNS guesses.

## Auth Path

- Sign-in path: `/login`
- Seeded admin account after `prisma/seed.ts`: the `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` value
  from `.env.staging`.
- Required post-seed action for shared staging: change the seed admin password
  before sharing the environment.

For role-specific checks, create or update test members through `Admin > Members` after signing in as the staging admin. Do not copy production user credentials into staging.

## Start Local Staging

From a clean checkout:

```bash
cp .env.staging.example .env.staging
```

Edit `.env.staging` and replace the placeholder secrets:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 48   # AUTH_SECRET and NEXTAUTH_SECRET
openssl rand -base64 24   # CRON_SECRET
openssl rand -base64 24   # DB_PASSWORD
```

Start the non-production app and database:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.staging -p tacbookings-staging \
  -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.staging.yml \
  up -d --build postgres app
```

Apply migrations and seed test data:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.staging -p tacbookings-staging \
  -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.staging.yml \
  run --rm migrate

docker compose --env-file .env.staging -p tacbookings-staging \
  -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.staging.yml \
  exec app npx tsx prisma/seed.ts
```

Verify the target:

```bash
curl -fsS http://localhost:3001/api/health
curl -fsS http://localhost:3001/api/health/ready
```

Stop it when finished:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.staging -p tacbookings-staging \
  -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.staging.yml \
  down
```

Add `-v` to the final command only when you intentionally want to delete the staging database volume.

## Accessibility Run

Run checks against the staging origin, not production. The minimum
release-review sweep is:

```bash
STAGING_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001

npx --yes lighthouse "$STAGING_BASE_URL" --only-categories=accessibility --chrome-flags="--headless"
npx --yes lighthouse "$STAGING_BASE_URL/login" --only-categories=accessibility --chrome-flags="--headless"
```

For authenticated pages:

1. Sign in at `/login`.
2. Open each target page manually in the same browser profile.
3. Run Lighthouse or the browser accessibility tool against that staging URL.
4. Record the page URL, user role, tool, result, and any exception in the linked
   issue or PR.

Recommended route set for formal review:

- `/`
- `/login`
- `/book`
- `/dashboard`
- `/bookings`
- `/profile`
- `/admin/dashboard`
- `/admin/bookings`
- `/admin/members`
- `/lodge`
- `/finance`

Only include authenticated routes that the staging test account is allowed to
access. If a page depends on Stripe, Xero, SES, or finance data that is not
configured in staging, record the dependency and use seeded or demo data instead
of production credentials.

## Shared Staging Notes

When promoting this target from local staging to a shared host:

1. Use a non-production domain and set `NEXTAUTH_URL` to that exact origin.
2. Use test-mode Stripe keys only.
3. Use Xero demo org credentials only when a test explicitly needs Xero.
4. Keep `CRON_ENABLED=false` unless the test explicitly needs scheduled jobs.
5. Keep `BACKUP_ENABLED=false` unless the test explicitly covers backup behavior.
6. Verify `/api/health` and `/api/health/ready` before starting browser checks.
7. Record the staging origin and auth path in the review issue or release notes.

## Automated Axe Findings (2026-07-04)

The automated axe pass over the member flow and key admin pages (#1106) was
resolved as follows: row-select checkboxes and filter selects on
`/admin/members` carry accessible names, the booking wizard's working-bee
select and the booking detail preferred-room select are labelled, the wizard
step indicator and dashboard draft-expiry text meet AA contrast
(`text-gray-600` / `text-amber-700`), `/login` has a screen-reader `h1`,
wizard/profile heading levels descend without jumps, and the top navigation
and admin sidebar `nav` landmarks are labelled ("Primary" / "Admin
sections"). `/admin/bookings` select names and chip contrast were fixed by
the PR #1102 Radix conversion. The full manual pass described above remains
outstanding.

## Manual Staging Pass (2026-07-04)

Run against the local staging compose stack at latest `main` (post-#1123):
axe-core (WCAG 2.1 AA + best-practice) across 17 pages — public (`/`,
`/login`, `/register`, `/forgot-password`, `/booking-requests`), the
two-factor enrolment flow, member (`/dashboard`, `/book`, `/profile`,
`/bookings`), and admin (members, bookings, booking-requests, health,
stuck-states, booking-policies) — plus keyboard spot checks on `/login`.

Fixed in this pass (#1170): public request form guest labels/select
association, invalid `autocomplete` token in the address autocomplete,
theme-switcher inactive-label contrast, `.website-eyebrow` contrast under
themable brand colours, booking-calendar availability-count contrast, a
skip-to-content link on both website layouts (the `/login` form sat 28 tab
stops deep), and a `/forgot-password` h1.

Remaining (moderate/best-practice) — handed to the #1149 deep pass with
full axe data: missing h1 on `/login/enroll` and the admin pages, and
website-footer h3 heading order on sparse pages. Screen-reader (NVDA/
VoiceOver) walkthroughs remain a human task.
