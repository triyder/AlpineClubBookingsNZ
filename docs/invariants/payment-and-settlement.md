# Payment And Settlement

Audience: Developer, Agent.

Prefix defined in this file: **`INV-PAY`** — how money is taken, cleared,
credited and refunded: settlement paths, account credit, Stripe and Xero
reconciliation, and group settlement.

Read this file when you are changing anything that takes, clears, credits or
refunds money.

Index: [`docs/DOMAIN_INVARIANTS.md`](../DOMAIN_INVARIANTS.md) — every `INV-*` ID
with a one-line description of what it covers. ID scheme and allocation rules:
[`SCHEME.md`](SCHEME.md).

Every heading below whose whole text is an `INV-*` ID defines that invariant. IDs
are permanent: never renumbered, never reused. **The text under each ID is a
verbatim move from the source document and must not be reworded in place** —
only the ID heading lines, and the editorial **Related:** lines directly beneath
some of them (#2707), were added. A `Related:` line is navigation, never part of
the rule: it names sibling IDs so a change to one prompts checking the others.

## INV-PAY-001

- **Manual mark-paid provenance for BOOKING payments (cash / off-Xero bank
  transfer), B5 #2262.** A booking's payment can be settled outside both Stripe
  and Xero by an audited finance:edit action, recorded on the existing `Payment`
  row by `manuallyMarkedPaidAt` / `manuallyMarkedPaidByMemberId` /
  `manualPaymentNote` / `manuallyMarkedPaidPreviousStatus`. Deliberately NO new
  `PaymentSource` member: the row settles as an ordinary `INTERNET_BANKING`
  payment, so every two-way branch in the codebase (refund-method coercion,
  refund planning, the reconciler) lands correctly, and the provenance columns
  carry the manual-ness. The provenance predicate everywhere is
  `manuallyMarkedPaidAt IS NOT NULL` **alone** — never conjoined with "carries
  no Xero id", because two stampers outside the cash-settle loop
  (`syncLinkedPaymentInvoiceMetadata` and the zero-cash arm of
  `invoice-paid-effects`) can legitimately stamp a Xero id onto a manual row and
  that must not launder its provenance.

## INV-PAY-038

- It is a SIBLING ENTRY POINT into the one settlement body in
  `payment-reconciliation.ts`, not a second settlement path: it executes the
  same lock ordering, the same post-lock re-read, the same
  `checkCapacityForGuestRanges` with its #1771 persisted-override carve-out,
  the same status-fenced PAID claim, the same bed reconciliation and the same
  durable `MEMBER_PAID` / `NON_MEMBER_CONFIRMED` event. It composes a THIRD
  lock tier (global → per-lodge → MEMBER-CREDIT) and derives the settlement
  amount itself: no client-supplied amount is ever accepted, and the mirror
  `amountCents + creditAppliedCents = finalPriceCents` is asserted explicitly.

## INV-PAY-039

- It NEVER calls Xero and NEVER creates or voids an invoice. Marking paid is
  refused (409) when the payment carries a Xero invoice id, a refund credit
  note, a Xero id on any of its transactions, an active `PRIMARY_INVOICE`
  object link, a completed CREATE-INVOICE outbox operation, **or one still in
  flight**, and when the booking participates in a group settlement
  (`organiserSettled`). Every condition that can be expressed as a WHERE is
  re-asserted inside the fenced `payment.updateMany`, so an invoice minted
  between read and write yields count 0 → 409, never a double-apply.

## INV-PAY-040

- A capacity failure REFUSES and records nothing (owner decision, 28 Jul).
  The Stripe path's cancel-and-refund is not mirrored: no in-system money fact
  exists yet, so refusal leaves zero debt, and the invariant holds identically
  because the same check runs at the same point under the same locks.

## INV-PAY-041

- Every outbound invoice-mint surface is fenced on THREE levels: at the
  `enqueueXeroBookingInvoiceOperation` choke point (which every enqueuer funnels
  through), at settle time (mark-paid refuses while a CREATE-INVOICE operation
  is PENDING/RUNNING/WAITING_PAYMENT), and in the handler
  `createXeroInvoiceForBooking`, which re-reads provenance at execution time and
  abandons an operation queued microseconds before the settle committed. Without
  all three a manual settlement would have a real awaiting-payment invoice raised
  AND EMAILED to the member for money already collected in cash. The
  missing-invoices sweep, the force-sync affordance and the repair classifier
  additionally treat a manual settlement as "no Xero objects expected".

## INV-PAY-042

- RECIPROCAL fence: an inbound Xero PAID landing on a manually settled booking
  raises a counter in the inbound result, an error log, a durable admin-only
  `BookingEvent` (once per payment+invoice) and a cooldown-throttled admin
  alert — never a quiet `alreadyPaid`. It fires across PAID, CANCELLED (or the
  inbound path would mint member credit for cash an OPEN hand-back task
  already owes back) and COMPLETED, and it runs BEFORE the settle loop's
  transaction update so a Xero invoice id is never stamped onto the manual
  settlement's rows.

## INV-PAY-043

- Duplicate-capture visibility: the #1992 distinctness predicate matches ANY
  settled PRIMARY transaction, not only a Stripe one, so a stray capture on a
  cash-settled (or Xero-inbound-settled) booking is auto-refunded instead of
  silently kept.

## INV-PAY-102

- **Card first, then bank: a booking is never collected by two instruments
  silently** (#3638).
- **The Internet Banking switch refuses unless the card intent is retired**
  (`isCardIntentRetired`): Stripe confirmed the cancel, the intent was already
  `canceled`, or it succeeded and the local ledger shows it refunded (#1765). A
  live capture, or a cancel that throws, is a 409 with no payment write and no
  invoice. Under lock(1) it refuses a payment now pointing at a different
  intent.
- **Every card door attaches through `attachMintedCardIntent`** —
  `create-payment-intent` and `/pay/<token>` — under lock(1), re-reading the
  payment's source and the booking's status and refusing an Internet Banking or
  no-longer-payable one. Neither order leaves a live card intent beside an
  invoice, and no card row flips a switched payment back to STRIPE.
- **Inbound, a second instrument is raised, never skipped.** Under the settle
  loop's lock(1), a PRIMARY capture of another source is a conflict on a PAID or
  COMPLETED booking while it holds net cash, and on a CANCELLED one while the
  bank cash is new. The bank receipt is recorded and nothing else moves. One
  admin-only marker per invoice is written IN that transaction, so it commits
  with the receipt; the unmuteable alert follows the commit, and the marker
  records it sent, so a crash in between re-sends it once on the retry. Not
  second instruments: an ADDITIONAL card row, a capture the #1992 refund owns
  (`INV-PAY-043`), and — on a settled booking — #1765 refund history, a card
  row refunded before the booking moved to Internet Banking.
- **A replay on a settled booking changes nothing.** COMPLETED takes the
  already-paid arm like PAID.
- Pinned by `switch-to-internet-banking-route.test.ts`,
  `payment-intent-routes.test.ts`, `payment-link.test.ts` and
  `issue-3638-second-instrument-conflict.test.ts`.

## INV-PAY-044

- CANCELLATION yields a durable `ManualRefundTask`, created atomically with the
  CANCELLED claim — never a Stripe refund plan, never a Xero credit note, never
  minted member credit, and never a "your refund is on its way to your card"
  email. The refund allocation is written only when the task is COMPLETED, so
  the ledger never claims money was returned before it was; the refund-appeal
  queue refuses to approve a manual-provenance payment. The policy math uses
  the bank-transfer/credit tier (owner decision, 28 Jul), so preview and
  execution agree.

## INV-PAY-045

- REVERSAL (finance:edit) is permitted only while nothing has happened that it
  could not undo: booking PAID, provenance present, no refund, no
  `PaymentRefund` rows, no settled Stripe transaction, no OPEN
  `ManualRefundTask`, and no Xero link or queued mint acquired since. It
  restores `manuallyMarkedPaidPreviousStatus` (a stored `DRAFT` deliberately
  restores as `PAYMENT_PENDING`, because the PAID claim cleared
  `draftExpiresAt` and a restored DRAFT would be an expiry-less draft
  forever), clears the provenance, marks the manual transaction FAILED rather
  than deleting it, clears a restored CONFIRMED internet-banking hold deadline
  (or the expiry cron would auto-cancel the booking minutes later), and
  DELETES every still-PENDING/PROCESSING `CANCEL_PAYMENT_INTENT` /
  `REFUND_SUPERSEDED_PAYMENT` operation on the payment — those operations
  must not outlive the settlement they were minted to protect, or a later
  legitimate capture would be refunded as if superseded. Deletion, not a
  terminal status flip: the webhook-side liveness predicates key on
  `status != SUCCEEDED`, so only a deleted row is invisible to all of them.
  The scope is safe because that set IS the settle's own hygiene: the
  settle's enqueue upserts on the shared cancel idempotency key (adopting any
  pre-existing cancel op), and a member-owed superseded refund can never be
  reached — the handoff that creates one marks its transaction SUCCEEDED
  first, and the reversal refuses on any settled Stripe transaction before
  the disarm. The deleted rows' full content is preserved in the reversal's
  `AuditLog` metadata.

## INV-PAY-046

- An OUTSTANDING upward-modification delta on the booking is never silently
  absorbed or silently left behind (#2397). `additionalAmountCents` /
  `additionalPaymentStatus` used to be written only by the CARD flow, so a price
  increase settled in cash still read as owing everywhere, including the
  automatic chase (#2350). The mark-paid dialog therefore ASKS (owner decision,
  31 Jul 2026) whenever the booking carries one, showing the amount before the
  change, the extra, and the total being recorded; the answer is a REQUIRED,
  defaultless part of the settle's contract, re-checked under the locks: an
  extra without an answer, an answer without an extra, and a figure that moved
  since the dialog rendered are each a 409 — the same law as
  `expectedAmountCents`.
  Said covered, the extra is settled through the columns every consumer reads
  (`additionalPaymentStatus = "SUCCEEDED"`, re-asserted in the fenced write) AND
  as a durable INTERNET_BANKING ADDITIONAL `PaymentTransaction` with reason
  `manual_mark_paid_additional`, because `reconcilePaymentAggregates` re-derives
  those columns from the latest ADDITIONAL transaction. **No money is created:** an upward modification raises `Booking.finalPriceCents` by the same delta it records as the extra, and this settle collects `finalPriceCents - credit` in one go, so the cash is SPLIT (the ADDITIONAL
  row carries the delta, the PRIMARY row the rest), so `Payment.amountCents` is
  the money the club took. An extra LARGER than the whole amount owing is
  refused on BOTH answers.
  Said NOT covered, the extra stays outstanding **and is subtracted from the
  settled figure** (owner decision, 31 Jul 2026): the settlement records
  `finalPriceCents - credit - outstandingAdditionalCents`. The PRIMARY figure is
  identical under both answers; the answer only decides whether an ADDITIONAL
  row sits beside it. A "not covered" answer whose extra IS the whole amount
  owing is refused: a $0 settlement must never flip a booking to PAID. What each
  answer does to the addition's Stripe intent, and what the admin and the member
  are each told, is `INV-PAY-058`.

## INV-PAY-058

- **A "not covered" settle leaves a WAY TO COLLECT the extra** (#2397). The
  settlement's blanket Stripe-intent cancellation SPARES exactly one intent — the
  payment's current `additionalPaymentIntentId`, only on "not covered" — because
  it is the member's only self-service door to the extra
  (`/api/bookings/[id]/additional-payment-secret`).
  Capturing it is ledger-correct: `reconcilePaymentAggregates` sums the captured
  rows, so `Payment.amountCents` becomes cash + addition = `finalPriceCents`.
  Superseded addition intents are still cancelled, and "covered" cancels the
  addition's intent too, because there a live intent would be a door to a SECOND
  payment. The admin's receipt and the member's confirmation both state which
  situation applies, and **the member's confirmation must agree with the admin's
  receipt**: a "not covered" settle sends the ordinary booking-confirmed message
  with the balance stated — Booking Total / Paid / Still Owing — and says whether
  the balance can be paid from the booking page or the club will be in touch.
- **A payment that has already taken money is refused at READ time**, not only
  at the fenced write. The settle-from statuses are PENDING / PROCESSING /
  FAILED; SUCCEEDED and the refunded variants are refused with a message that
  says so, and the admin booking page's advisory state applies the same rule so
  the action is not offered at all. The three payment-level refusals are checked
  in the SAME ORDER on both surfaces — refund history, then already-captured,
  then Xero evidence. Refund history leads because it is the most specific truth (a fully REFUNDED payment is a captured one too, and only the refund message names the remedy); Xero trails because the cheap in-memory refusals should settle it without the extra lookups `assertNoXeroInvoiceEvidence` costs inside the locked transaction.
- **Reachability, stated plainly.** With the read-time refusal in place, no
  production path is known that presents the coverage question on a settle that
  can COMPLETE other than the reverse-then-re-settle loop and legacy pre-ledger
  rows. Every writer of `additionalAmountCents` requires the payment to be captured at the moment the delta is recorded (`applyPaymentAdjustments` arm (a) needs `hasCapturedPayment`; arm (b) needs an issued Xero invoice, which this settle refuses outright and which nothing ever clears), and a captured payment is not a legal settle-from. Re-check this if the settle-from status set or the delta writers
  change.

## INV-PAY-047

- **The ledger mirror, generalised (#2397).**
  `amountCents + creditAppliedCents = finalPriceCents` is only the special case
  where nothing is left owing. What holds in every case is
  `amountCents + creditAppliedCents + (uncollected addition) = finalPriceCents`:
  every cent of the price is collected, paid with credit, or still owed.
  This is NOT enforced by a runtime assertion inside the settle, and cannot be:
  the settled figure is *defined* as `finalPriceCents - credit - uncollected`,
  so any in-transaction check reduces to `finalPrice === finalPrice`. What
  enforces it is (1) CONSTRUCTION — the PRIMARY and ADDITIONAL rows are a split
  of one figure, which is what `Payment.amountCents` is set to; (2) THE FENCE —
  the fenced `payment.updateMany` re-asserts the outstanding delta (on BOTH
  answers), the settle-from status, the zero refund history and the absence of
  Xero evidence as WHERE clauses, so a concurrent writer yields count 0 → 409;
  and (3) AFTER THE FACT — the booking-ledger census (`INV-MONEY-037`) checks
  every booking's `amountCents`, `creditAppliedCents` and uncollected
  addition against its ledger lines over committed data. **(3) is not a safety
  net for this settle**: it is an operator-run command, not a scheduled job or
  an alert.
  Either answer is recorded on the mark-paid audit row BOTH ways — with the
  settled figure written, the amount owing, and what was deliberately left
  uncollected. A covered extra also writes
  `booking-payment.manual-payment.additional-settled`, and the REVERSAL gives
  back exactly what its settle took: the reversed amount is the figure that was
  written, and a covered extra goes back to owing (ADDITIONAL row → FAILED,
  column restored by a guarded claim matching exactly what the settle wrote).

  **The mirror is net of refunds, carries the change fee, and is what SIZES an
  ask (#3340).** Three things the #2397 statement above left implicit, each of
  which was a live defect:

  - **Net, never gross.** `paidAmountCents = amountCents - refundedAmountCents`.
    The manual-settle path was made net-correct in July 2026; the edit path and
    the payments board were not. `/admin/payments` rendered gross beside a
    "Partially refunded" chip, so a $130 capture with $65 refunded read as "paid
    $130" and a booking officer sized the balance at `430 - 130 = 300` when the
    true figure was `430 - 65 = 365`. Both wrong numbers agreed with each other,
    which is why nobody caught it.
  - **`Payment.changeFeeCents` is a term.** A change fee is charged through an
    ask but is never added to `Booking.finalPriceCents`, so the mirror holds only
    as `finalPrice + changeFee = net paid + credit + uncollected ask`.
  - **An ask is sized so the mirror still holds after it.** Minting a replacement
    ADDITIONAL PaymentIntent RETIRES every other outstanding ask on the payment
    (`queueSupersededAdditionalIntentCancellations`), so an ask sized on one
    edit's own delta deletes the unpaid balance of the ask it replaces. Two
    consecutive +$70 edits on a $130 paid booking asked $70 and lost $70,
    permanently and silently: once the mis-sized ask was paid the booking page
    stopped rendering the payment card and the reminder cron stopped, so the
    shortfall became unreachable from every member- and officer-facing surface.
    The ask is therefore the edit's own net PLUS the unpaid balance of the ask it
    supersedes, which is `sizeAdditionalAsk` in
    `src/lib/additional-payment-ask.ts` — the one home for all of this
    arithmetic, and the module the census guard and the operator SQL are both
    folded from.

  **WHY THE ASK IS NOT READ STRAIGHT OFF THE PRICE.** `finalPriceCents - net paid
  - creditAppliedCents` is the same figure wherever the ledger is clean, and the
  tests assert that agreement rather than asserting it in prose. It stops being
  the same figure in exactly the cases where the club legitimately holds money
  that is NOT the booking's price, and there it gives that money back: after a
  policy-tiered reduction the retained slice ([INV-MOD-011]) is a CHARGE, not a
  prepayment, and after a reduction settled as account credit `amountCents` is
  untouched while the member holds `MemberCredit` — so a price-derived ask would
  discount the member's next increase by the retention. It would also fold any
  pre-existing under-collection into the next ask, which is the retro-correction
  the owner ruled out (#3340, 8 Sep 2026); the affected members were invoiced by
  hand instead.

  **THE PROJECTION STAYS A PROJECTION (#3340 scope item 2, decided).**
  `reconcilePaymentAggregates` goes on writing
  `additionalAmountCents: latestAdditional?.amountCents ?? 0` — the latest
  ADDITIONAL transaction's amount — and is NOT changed to recompute an
  outstanding from `Booking.finalPriceCents`. Three reasons, in order of weight.
  It is a pure ledger projection: every other column it writes derives from the
  `PaymentTransaction` rows, and giving one column a second, disagreeing source
  of truth is the defect this whole entry is about. It would collide with the
  manual-settle path, which deliberately RE-ASSERTS these columns behind a fence
  and would find them rewritten underneath it. And post-#3267/#3268 the function
  has already learned to preserve the Payment's own intent pointer and card
  column rather than always following the latest transaction
  ([INV-PAY-054], [INV-PAY-055]), so the direction of travel is toward respecting
  what other writers own, not away from it. The cost of leaving it is that a
  future mis-size would still be permanent; the compensating control is the
  census below, which makes one visible instead of silent.

  **THE CENSUS IS A REPORT, NOT A REPAIR.** `bookingLedgerCensusSql` lists every
  live booking with a captured payment whose residual is not zero, and
  `pnpm run payments:audit-booking-ledger` runs it read-only. A POSITIVE residual
  is money the price says is owed that no ask is collecting; a NEGATIVE one is
  the club holding more than the price, which is the expected shape after a
  policy-retained or credit-settled reduction. Nothing repairs either
  automatically — the owner's 8 Sep 2026 decision, for a population of two rows
  already handled by hand.

  **An Internet Banking price increase is an EXPECTED positive**, because it is
  billed on a supplementary Xero invoice and raises no ADDITIONAL
  `PaymentTransaction` for the ask term to see. Invoicing one by hand would bill
  the member twice. A term reading the Xero outbox was considered and rejected:
  it would make this identity depend on an external queue's state, where
  "queued", "failed" and "sent" are three different answers to "is the club
  asking for this?" that only a person can weigh. The operator guide
  ([`MAINTENANCE.md`](../MAINTENANCE.md)) says so at the point of use.

  **WHAT THE CI HALF GUARDS, EXACTLY** (`src/lib/__tests__/booking-ledger-census.test.ts`).
  It is two guards, and conflating them overstates both. The ARITHMETIC guard
  replays booking edits through the production sizing function and fails on any
  positive residual, naming this id — it proves the sizing RULE, reads no fixture
  and no seed data, and is blind by construction to any door that never calls
  that function. One such door was open when it was written. The CALL-SITE census
  is the half that can see a door: it scans the source tree for every file that
  mints an ADDITIONAL PaymentIntent, pins the module that sizes each one, and
  fails on a new door or on an exemption that has quietly stopped being true.
  Neither reads production data; "fails CI if any booking's arithmetic does not
  balance" would be a claim about rows, and rows are what the OPERATOR census
  above is for.

## INV-PAY-048

- A stored, unconsumed credit election (#2265) on the booking is never
  silently stranded or ignored (door 3 of the #2319 invariant below): the
  settle clears it with the shared guarded claim, records the cleared cents
  on the mark-paid audit row, and reports it post-commit through
  `reportUnappliedCreditElection` (source `manual-mark-paid`) — the member's
  booking history says their credit was not used and is still available, and
  an operator is alerted to decide whether to refund the difference. The
  reversal does not resurrect a cleared election, so reversal-then-re-mark
  clears and reports exactly once.

## INV-PAY-049

- Both directions are audited with the acting admin and the previous status;
  marking paid also records the #2260 email decision BOTH ways.

## INV-PAY-050

- A Xero Stripe refund credit note (and its Stripe-bank refund payment)
  documents PROVIDER-BACKED CASH only, never account credit. The amount those
  documents may cover is `resolveStripeCashRefundEvidence`
  (`src/lib/stripe-cash-refund-evidence.ts`): the payment's `PaymentRefund`
  cents excluding only `failed` and `canceled` rows when any ledger rows exist,
  else the pre-ledger fallback of `refundedAmountCents` minus its
  account-credit disposition —
  never the raw `refundedAmountCents` mirror, which deliberately tracks both
  dispositions (#1031) and stays authoritative for settlement and
  conservation maths. Bound at every surface that can mint or size a refund
  note: health detection (`getRefundsMissingXeroCreditNotes`), the daily
  self-heal enqueue amount, the STRIPE enqueue cap, the execution-time delta
  recompute in `createXeroCreditNote` (which also completes a queued
  fictitious operation without billing Xero), and the #2901 link-repair
  coverage target. An account-credit cancellation therefore keeps exactly its
  `ACCOUNT_CREDIT_NOTE` and never grows a refund note (#2902).
- The exclusion list is deliberately the SAME as the `refundedAmountCents`
  mirror's (`EXCLUDED_LEDGER_REFUND_STATUSES`), so a refund Stripe has accepted
  but not yet settled keeps counting as cash exactly as it did before #2902
  (owner decision, 21 Aug 2026). Counting only `succeeded` would fix the
  account-credit defect while introducing the opposite reporting error — a
  still-settling refund resolving to zero cash, so the note UNDER-states what
  went back until somebody re-runs the report. The accepted cost is the one
  non-fail-safe limit in this module: a refund that is accepted and later
  `failed` counts as cash between those two events, bounded by the
  `refundedAmountCents` clamp and corrected by the next run.

## INV-PAY-103

- **A card refund ADDS to a transaction's `refundedAmountCents` exactly the
  money it newly recorded, through one writer** (#3640). The mirror also counts
  account-credit settlements, which leave no `PaymentRefund` row, so a
  `max(stored, card refunds)` formula loses a card refund made after a credit
  and lets a later cancel pay it out again. `recordStripeRefundsAgainstTransaction`
  (`src/lib/payment-transactions.ts`) is the only card-refund writer of that
  column — the inline refund, the `charge.refunded` sync and the
  superseded-payment recovery. It adds a refund only when its own
  `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` insert recorded it, in a counted status, made no
  earlier than the second the ledger-writers migration finished on this install
  (an older one is already in the mirror); it subtracts a counted refund it sees
  move to failed or cancelled, never below the payment's account credit plus
  its card refunds still counted (a refund the old formula never added, failing
  later, takes nothing). Rows, mirror and aggregate commit in one transaction.
- **Every later write of that column is one compare-and-set**, re-read and
  retried: the writer above, #1491's fold and `applyLocalRefundAllocation`, which
  refuses only when headroom is gone. All take the `Payment` row first
  (`lockPaymentForRefundedTotal`), then refund rows, then transaction rows.
- Two writers set an organiser-settled child's mirror directly, because the
  child has no transaction rows: the pre-#3653 group-settlement path
  (`INV-PAY-031`–`037`) and the organiser child refund executor
  (`organiser-child-refund-executor.ts`, [`INV-PAY-114`](#inv-pay-114)), which
  records each Stripe refund's row first.
- Pinned by `payment-transactions-refunds.test.ts` and
  `card-refund-mirror-races.realdb.test.ts`. Totals the old formula left short
  are listed by `pnpm run payments:audit-refunded-total`, never repaired by code.

## INV-PAY-002

- Account credit is consumed only by a booking that is actually reaching
  `PAYMENT_PENDING`, never by one that is still provisional. A booking saved as
  a draft therefore stores the member's ELECTION on
  `Booking.creditElectionCents` (nullable integer cents, #2265) and consumes
  nothing: NULL means no election is outstanding, `0` means the member
  explicitly chose to use none, and a positive value is what they asked to
  apply. A draft that is abandoned, deleted or expires leaves the balance
  untouched, so no release path exists or is needed. The election is
  single-consumption — the pay path clears it to NULL in the same transaction
  that writes the `BOOKING_APPLIED` ledger row — and it is NEVER a record of
  credit already applied: the authoritative applied total is always the
  MemberCredit ledger (`deriveBookingAppliedCreditCents`). ANY booking held for
  admin review keeps its election until an admin releases it to
  `PAYMENT_PENDING` — a saved draft that landed in `AWAITING_REVIEW` and a
  booking the confirmed-create path parked there via `blockForReview` alike.
  Holding for review suppresses the SPEND, never the member's request.

## INV-PAY-003

- The EDIT path may write the election too (#2266), and only onto the statuses
  whose election a consumer will later honour: `DRAFT`, `AWAITING_REVIEW`, and
  `PAYMENT_PENDING` (`resolveCreditElectionUpdate`, evaluated against the
  POST-lifecycle status of the edit). `PENDING` is deliberately refused even
  though members can edit PENDING bookings — `charge-saved-method` requires
  `PENDING` and consumes no election, so "no election-bearing booking is ever
  in PENDING" must stay true; the hold release lands the booking in
  `PAYMENT_PENDING`, where the member can elect. A positive election is also
  refused once money is captured or when the booking is organiser-settled; an
  explicit `0` clears; an edit that settles the booking at $0 drops the
  now-moot request silently (the confirm-draft posture). The edit stores the
  RAW requested cents exactly as draft-create does — clamping stays at the
  consumer. A modification that carries ONLY a credit election is
  price-preserving by construction: it takes the identity-only echo (no pricing
  engine, no capacity check) so a season-rate change can never reprice an
  untouched booking, and it sends no change-notification email.

## INV-PAY-004

- Members may edit their OWN drafts (#2266) — that is what the dashboard's
  Resume button has always implied. A draft edit moves no money and claims no
  capacity: no change fee (`calculateModificationChangeFee` returns 0 for
  `DRAFT`), no `nonMemberHoldUntil` stamp (`applyLifecycleTransitions` skips
  the hold rail for `DRAFT`), no settlement — the pay step / $0 confirm-draft
  enforce capacity and holds when the draft becomes real. `DRAFT` therefore
  joins `MEMBER_FUTURE_EDIT_STATUSES` but stays OUT of the (now frozen)
  active-edit-lifecycle set, so admin draft edits keep skipping lifecycle
  rules byte-for-byte as before. A member draft edit still gets the wizard's
  over-capacity CHECK (#1767 parity) at quote and apply.

## INV-PAY-005

- The election is consumed by a guarded CLAIM, not a read-then-write (#2265):
  the column is moved from the exact amount that was read to NULL with an
  `updateMany` matching the booking id, `PAYMENT_PENDING` and that amount, in
  the same transaction as the ledger write. Two concurrent consumers therefore
  cannot both debit the member; the loser applies nothing and reports nothing,
  because a phantom outcome would produce a second confirmation email, a second
  Xero invoice and a second `MEMBER_PAID` event. There are exactly two
  consumers — the card pay step and the Internet Banking switch — and both take
  the per-member credit-ledger lock before the claim and refuse (leaving the
  election intact) before consuming when capacity is gone. An
  organiser-settled booking can never consume one, so group settlement clears
  the column instead.

## INV-PAY-006

- A stored credit election is CLAMPED at confirmation, never refused, and never
  applied short in silence (#2265). Between the election and the confirmation
  the balance may have been spent elsewhere and the booking may have been
  repriced, so the amount applied is
  `min(election, live balance, price not already covered by credit)` — the same
  posture `clampAppliedCreditToBookingPrice` (#1887) takes when a modification
  reprices a booking below its applied credit, and for the same reason: throwing
  would leave the member unable to pay their own booking. The requested amount,
  the applied amount, the shortfall and its cause are returned by the pay route
  so the shortfall is always surfaced. `calculateBookingCreditApplication` keeps
  its throw-on-over-request contract at booking-create, where the wizard
  validated the balance in the same request and an over-request is a bug. The
  reported reason names the bound that ACTUALLY bound — the lower of the two —
  and reads `balance_and_price` only when the balance and the uncovered price
  are equal and both below the request; a bound that sits under the request but
  above the other decided nothing and is not reported.

## INV-PAY-007

- A booking with nothing left to pay settles at $0 inside the pay transaction
  rather than dead-ending at the card-intent effective-price guard (#2265):
  status `PAID` plus one $0 `SUCCEEDED` Payment mirroring the applied credit,
  the same zero-dollar shape booking-create and the modification engine use,
  keeping `amountCents + creditAppliedCents = finalPriceCents`. This covers a
  fully-covering election, a booking already covered by credit applied
  elsewhere, and a draft repriced to $0 between the member rendering the pay
  step and clicking it — the last of which previously committed
  `DRAFT -> PAYMENT_PENDING` and only then refused, stranding a booking that
  had left `DRAFT` and could never be paid. The settlement clears the Payment's
  card-intent pointers but keeps `stripePaymentMethodId`, which a split
  parent's deferred non-member guest charge falls back to.

## INV-PAY-008

- **A $0 waitlist confirm always ends in a state the member or a worker can
  move** (#2623). `POST /api/bookings/[id]/waitlist-confirm` is two-phase:
  phase one commits `WAITLIST_OFFERED -> PAYMENT_PENDING` and, in doing so,
  **consumes the offer** (`waitlistOfferedAt`, `waitlistOfferExpiresAt` and
  `waitlistPosition` are all nulled). A $0 booking sitting in `PAYMENT_PENDING`
  therefore holds no capacity, has no payment path and has no offer to replay,
  so every way phase two (the `PAYMENT_PENDING -> PAID` claim) can fail must
  either return the booking to `WAITLISTED` for the ordinary offer worker or say
  plainly that it could not. There are exactly four end states, and each one is a
  distinct coded response carrying `offerRevoked: true`
  (`src/lib/waitlist-confirm-recovery-contract.ts`):
  - capacity was lost under the locks — restored to `WAITLISTED` inside the same
    transaction, `WAITLIST_OFFER_RELEASED_CAPACITY` (409);
  - the booking moved under another writer — nothing written,
    `WAITLIST_CONFIRM_STATUS_MOVED` (409) with `bookingStatusUnconfirmed`, never
    a "capacity is gone" claim it cannot support;
  - phase two threw and the compensating release succeeded — the participant
    fence's frozen 409 (or `WAITLIST_CONFIRM_RELEASED_UNAVAILABLE`, 503 for
    contention) with `waitlistPlaceRestored: true`;
  - the compensating release itself failed — `WAITLIST_CONFIRM_AWAITING_OPERATOR`
    (503 for contention, else 500) with `awaitingOperatorRecovery: true`, plus a
    `critical` audit row (`waitlist.confirm_offer_release_failed`) so the
    operator-only state is searchable rather than silent.
  `WaitlistOfferCard` keys on `offerRevoked` — **not** on the error code, because
  a *phase-one* refusal shares `HOSTING_COVERAGE_PARTICIPANT_RETRY` with a
  phase-two one while leaving the offer intact — and withdraws the CTA in favour
  of "Reload booking status" whenever the flag is present. Money stays in integer
  cents throughout: the $0 `SUCCEEDED` Payment row is written only after the
  `PAID` claim succeeds, because a lost claim `return`s (and therefore commits),
  and `Payment.bookingId` is unique, so a row written before the claim would read
  as paid and block the booking's real payment row forever.

## INV-PAY-009

- No SETTLED booking carries a stored credit election (#2265, #2319). Once the
  money has been taken for the amount the intent or the invoice was raised at,
  "applying" the election would debit the member's balance for cash they have
  already handed over. So every settlement CLEARS the column, with the same
  guarded claim on the exact amount read (`clearStaleCreditElection`) that the
  consumers use, so a consumer racing the settle is never clobbered:
  - `markBookingPaymentSucceeded` — the single door the Stripe webhook, the
    session confirm, the public payment link, the saved-card charge and the
    auto-confirm cron all funnel through — clears on its `PAID` claim.
  - The Internet Banking inbound reconcile clears on its `PAID` flip, and on the
    late-capacity-failure `CANCELLED` flip in the same writer.
  - The repriced-to-$0 auto-pay arms of both modification services clear, as
    `confirm-draft`'s $0 confirm and group settlement already did.
  - The manual mark-paid settlement (#2262) clears on its `PAID` claim: the
    admin collected the full amount owing OUTSIDE the app, so the member's credit
    was NOT spent. The cleared cents are recorded on the mark-paid audit row
    (`clearedCreditElectionCents`). The reversal RESTORES exactly what
    that settle cleared, writing it to `Booking.creditElectionCents` under a
    guard matching `null`. Restoration is required:
    nothing outside booking-create can set that column, so a reversal that left
    it null would strand a member holding credit they had elected. Both figures
    are recorded on the mark-unpaid audit row (`restoredCreditElectionCents`,
    `settleClearedCreditElectionCents`).
  Clearing is the answer ONLY once the money is taken. While a booking is still
  payable the election remains honourable and must be consumed or left alone —
  never discarded to make a charge simpler. A reprice that leaves a booking
  payable keeps its election, and the public payment link REFUSES a booking that
  carries one (below) rather than clearing it.

## INV-PAY-010

- Whether the clear is reported depends on whether the member lost anything. A
  clear on a $0 settlement is silent: nothing was owed, so the election was moot
  rather than unhonoured. A clear on a settlement that took real money is
  reported through `reportUnappliedCreditElection` — an audit row under
  `booking.credit_election.unapplied`, which the member's own booking history
  renders as a plain-English note ("your credit was not used for this booking and
  your balance was not reduced"), plus an operator alert so someone can decide
  whether to refund anything. A cleared column is invisible, and without the note
  a member who chose to spend credit and then paid full price could not tell
  whether their balance had been debited. It never is: a clear moves no money.

## INV-PAY-011

- Neither report may quote the ELECTED figure as if it were still available. The
  election records a choice made when the booking was created, which can be
  months and several bookings ago, so a member who elected $450 and has since
  spent down to $50 still carries a $450 election. The shared reporter therefore
  reads the member's LIVE balance once (`getMemberCreditBalance`) and records it
  on the audit row as `availableCreditCents`, with
  `refundableCents = min(election, balance)`. The member's history note quotes the
  live balance; the operator alert's headline Amount is the refundable figure, it
  says plainly when the balance has moved since, and it says "there is nothing to
  refund" rather than "refund at most $0.00" when the balance is gone. If the
  balance read fails the copy omits every availability figure rather than falling
  back to the overstating one. This binds all three doors — Stripe capture, Xero
  invoice-paid and the manual mark-paid — because it lives in the one reporter.

## INV-PAY-012

- The public payment link never spends, and never ignores, a member's credit
  election (#2319). `createPaymentIntentForPaymentLink` refuses (409) a booking
  carrying one instead of minting an intent at the pre-credit price. The reason
  is authorisation, not convenience: the election is a member's request to spend
  their own account-credit balance, and that route is authenticated by a bearer
  token routinely held by someone else (a booking requester, a group joiner, a
  non-member guest), carries no member session, and has no surface on which to
  report a clamped outcome. Nothing is lost by refusing — the member's own pay
  step honours the election — and no mint path attaches a link to a booking that
  can carry one, so the guard asserts that invariant rather than serving routine
  traffic, and alerts an operator if it ever fires.

## INV-PAY-013

- Stripe and Internet Banking/Xero settlement paths must remain distinct.

## INV-PAY-014

- Stripe paths own PaymentIntents, SetupIntents, Stripe refunds, Stripe
  webhooks, and durable PaymentRecoveryOperation rows.

## INV-PAY-015

- Internet Banking bookings issue Xero-backed invoices and reconcile settlement
  through Xero invoice/payment state.

## INV-PAY-016

- Internet Banking defaults are non-holding and no-cutoff. If bed holding is
  enabled, the hold expiry is snapshotted on the Payment and must be released
  idempotently by cron if unpaid.
- Never once the stay has started (#3663): check-in on or before the club's
  today (`bookingStayHasStarted`) is skipped before any Xero read, counted
  `skippedStarted` and alerted to finance once, for reconciliation by hand,
  under the same claim rule as `INV-PAY-109` (`sendAdminAlertOnceEver`). An
  Internet Banking organiser-pays group with an invoice, past its deadline,
  follows it too, whatever Xero shows of it ([INV-PAY-105]). Pinned by `internet-banking-payment-cron.test.ts` and
  `cron-group-settlement-reaper.test.ts`.

## INV-PAY-017

- The hold-expiry release and its invoice-clearing credit-note outbox row
  commit in ONE transaction (#1357): the release marks the hold consumed, so a
  post-commit enqueue would ride a crash window with no self-heal. The enqueue
  is a local insert; the Xero call stays in the outbox worker.
- **The note clears the booking's invoicing; it is not a refund** (#3535). It
  is the booking-anchored modification credit note the never-captured cancel
  path and the repair tool's cancelled-open-invoice arm also raise
  (`clearsUnpaidInvoice`): no credit-note payment, worded *Invoice cleared -
  booking not paid* (homed with the refund wordings, [INV-PAY-101]). The
  builder allocates it across the primary and any supplementary invoice, each
  up to what Xero says it owes, and creates nothing when they owe less
  (`xero-clearing-allocations.ts`). A FAILED note is retried, and a PARTIAL one
  re-allocated, from what its row recorded.
- **One size**, `unpaidInvoiceClearingAmountCents`: `max(0, finalPrice +
  changeFee − Xero-allocated applied credit)`, never the credit-reduced payment
  amount (#1597). Only credit allocated to the invoice as a Xero credit note is
  subtracted; the 100% local restore does not double-count. Gated on an ISSUED
  invoice.
- **Only an unpaid hold is released**: one with any payment against its
  invoices is kept ([INV-PAY-107]).
- One note per booking: the enqueue stands down on the booking's active
  clearing-note link or a live operation with its key; the repair arm while a
  clearing operation is live or failed, proposes none once late cash retired
  one, and never auto-retries a shortfall or a note over a recorded part
  payment ([INV-PAY-107]). The cron never re-selects a released
  hold, including one released before #3535 with a refund note; the repair tool
  still can (#3639).
  `scripts/audit-ib-hold-clearing.ts` counts only allocated clearing
  (read-only).

## INV-PAY-107

- **An expired internet-banking hold with any payment against its invoices is
  kept, not released** (#3643; owner option A, 26 September 2026).
  Xero is read live before any transaction (primary and supplementary
  invoices; cash by `classifyXeroInvoiceCashEvidence`). A clean read wins; the
  inbound sync's `PAYMENT` links (`isRecordedBookingInvoicePayment`, one rule
  with the #3535 audit) count only when Xero cannot answer, and, for links newer
  than the read, in the release's re-check, narrowing, not closing, the race;
  the builder's shortfall refusal backs it.
- **An unreadable invoice is kept up to seven days past the deadline**
  (`UNREADABLE_INVOICE_HOLD_BOUND_MS`, shared with [INV-PAY-105]), then
  released (a 404 counts); a started stay never is ([INV-PAY-016]). Its
  clearing note waits for the builder to read what the invoices owe.
- **One admin alert per hold per reason**, claim-guarded: a send that threw is
  given back, one nobody received retried daily (owed once the hold is gone),
  and a release's audit row is written regardless. Live reads: 20 a run, 400
  holds a day.
- **The cancel path recognises the part payment**: the claim
  re-checks for payments recorded since its read, records Xero's exact cash as
  captured, so the policy tiers it as credit, and queues a note for
  the unpaid rest (*Unpaid balance cleared - booking cancelled*, [INV-PAY-101]).
  Money it cannot credit (an organisation's, or unsizable) is an officer's
  unpaid cancel with no note and an alert (DECISION 2); the claim raises one
  amountless, dismiss-only hand-back task per payment (owner decision, 28
  September 2026). The preview shares the reader, cached a minute.
- The repair tool raises manual review, never a queued or retried full
  clearing note, over a recorded part payment, until that task is closed; a
  recognised one bypasses [INV-PAY-106]'s skips until its rest note resolves.

## INV-PAY-108

- **A part payment under review is never handed back twice** (#3643,
  orchestrator decision 3 within the owner's 28 September 2026 decision).
  While the review task [INV-PAY-107]'s cancel raises exists, open or
  dismissed, a PAID event for its invoice makes the inbound sync's late-cash
  arms (an organisation's hand-back, a member's account credit) size and mint
  nothing. They find the task by its marker, never by `paymentId`.
- Instead, in the same transaction, the sync writes onto the task when it
  learned the invoice was paid and the invoice's cash in cents, once (a replay
  adds nothing), and reopens a dismissed task; the queue card shows it. An
  email is attempted too, but it is best-effort: the note is the record
  (`part-payment-review-cover.ts`).
- An OPEN task counts as a recorded payment for the Xero repair tool, with or
  without a local `PAYMENT` link, so it never offers the full clearing note.

## INV-PAY-018

- Cancelling a booking never rewrites captured-payment truth (#1473). "Captured"
  is decided on LEDGER evidence — a payment transaction row in a captured status
  (SUCCEEDED / (PARTIALLY_)REFUNDED), or, for STRIPE rows with no ledger rows,
  the refund mirror — never on the aggregate mirror alone, which the inbound
  reconcile folds invoice-applied modification credit notes into on
  never-captured IB payments. A never-captured payment flips to FAILED at cancel
  and its open invoice gets the finalPrice+changeFee invoice-clearing credit note
  (the #1015 outstanding-balance rule). A genuinely captured PARTIALLY_REFUNDED
  payment takes the PAID cancellation path (#1491, owner decision): the member
  receives the cancellation-policy tier of the REMAINING captured value
  (`refundableBase = min(amountCents − refundedAmountCents, finalPrice +
  changeFee) − changeFee`; change fees stay non-refundable), with the same
  claim-first single-flight, frozen card-refund plan, and credit-path ledger
  writes as a SUCCEEDED cancel. Paid-path eligibility is LEDGER-ONLY
  (`paymentEligibleForPaidCancelPath`, shared with the cancel-preview route so
  preview and cancel can never disagree); mirror-only legacy rows stay in the
  preserve branch. Two paid-path rules keep money truth intact: a captured
  INTERNET_BANKING payment's refund method is coerced to "credit" before the tier
  is computed, and any folded (mirror-only) refund is materialized into the
  capture ledger inside the claim transaction before new refunds execute. A
  captured payment that stays out of the paid path (fully REFUNDED, or a
  flattened legacy mirror) keeps its status and refund history, its captured
  Stripe intent is not sent a cancel, and no clearing note is enqueued. The
  repair pass's late-capture finding fires only when a cancelled booking retains
  captured value with NO recorded cancellation-refund decision (no CANCELLED
  policy snapshot, no cancellation credit, no LIVE booking-cancel refund recovery
  operation) and is never auto-applied: an operator executes it with
  `--apply --apply-action <key>` (#1491). Rows flattened by the old defect are
  not backfilled.

## INV-PAY-106

- **Nothing later re-decides what a cancellation settled** (#3639). One rule,
  `classifyCaptureOnCancelledBooking` (`src/lib/cancellation-settled-money.ts`).
  A decision is a paid-path policy snapshot (recognised by shape, so unpaid
  auto-cancel and hold-expiry snapshots and the #2262 markers are not), a
  cancellation credit or a live cancel-refund recovery.
- **Both late-capture handlers** acknowledge a success notice on a `CANCELLED`
  booking — no refund, Xero note or status write — when the capture is not
  known to have landed after the cancel and the cancel recorded a decision, or
  when any of it was already refunded (`captureRefundState`, which reads the
  refunded total). "Landed after" is the primary handler's own
  `cancelled_booking_late_capture` write or a `CANCEL_PAYMENT_INTENT` recovery
  for the intent. Each writes `booking.payment.late_notice_acknowledged`. A
  replay after a refund skips the epilogue, so a hard kill mid-epilogue is left
  to the repair tool. The paid-path `CANCELLED` event commits inside the claim.
- **A genuine late capture follows the club's setting** (owner decision 26 Sep
  2026, [#3639](https://github.com/thatskiff33/AlpineClubBookingsNZ/issues/3639#issuecomment-5845224249)),
  including a change payment the superseded-intent hand-off catches: refunded
  automatically (default) or held as one #2700-kind task per intent, marked by
  `lateCaptureApprovalIntentId`. Approval is the automatic refund, same Stripe
  keys; a task of any status owns its capture, and the repair tool offers no
  refund behind it. A #2700 hand-back is refused once its capture was refunded.
  Kept money is recorded in Xero (`INV-PAY-110`).
- **The repair tool's cancelled-open-invoice arm** asks "was money captured?"
  of every source and skips a payment already carrying a refund or
  account-credit note, or such an operation queued or failed.

## INV-PAY-110

**Related: `INV-PAY-106`** (who decides a late capture) **and `INV-PAY-104`**
(the change payment's waiting invoice).

- **A kept late capture is recorded as a card receipt** (owner and
  orchestrator decisions 29 Sep 2026, [#3635](https://github.com/thatskiff33/AlpineClubBookingsNZ/issues/3635)):
  an invoice for the GROSS capture, paid from `stripeBankAccount`, both dated
  the club day of the Stripe charge (`stripe-capture-date.ts`), stored on the
  row before the send. Keeping is dismissing the #3639 task; one pure
  `decideLateCapture` (`late-capture-kept-xero-rules.ts`) answers everywhere.
- **Which document**: a change payment on an invoiced booking keeps its
  supplementary invoice, also charge-dated; anything else gets a
  `KEPT_LATE_CAPTURE_INVOICE` anchored on the task, touching neither the
  booking's invoice nor its clearing note.
- **Refunds** are the ordinary refund note, owed only once the APP recorded
  the capture's receipt (`readLateCaptureXeroReceipt`), never because
  `payment.xeroInvoiceId` exists. Noted per capture (`noteLateCaptureRefunds`),
  naming its receipt, dated the refund's day. Refunds of a capture without one
  are outside the note-eligible cash (`refund-note-eligible-cash.ts`), so the
  self-heal never raises them.
- **The task row is the lock**: the enqueue and the worker's send-time check
  take it `FOR UPDATE`. A raised invoice's payment is retried whatever the
  task's status, by the repair tool too. An approval withdraws an unsent row;
  one already past its check still sends, and its worker notes the refund.
- **The repair tool** queues a missing one (`KEPT_LATE_CAPTURE_WITHOUT_XERO_INVOICE`).
  Its late-capture refund writes the webhook's record first, then notes per
  capture the same way (#3635).
- **Resolved in Xero** (`INV-INT-025`): the app neither re-sends it nor notes
  its refunds; `KEPT_LATE_CAPTURE_REFUND_RECORD_BY_HAND` asks an officer to.

## INV-PAY-019

- Applied account credit is conserved across cancellation (#1547): EVERY
  `cancelBooking` branch — and the automatic cancels (Internet-Banking
  hold-expiry release, `internet-banking-payment-cron.ts`, and both capacity
  cancels, #3792) — reverses the negative `BOOKING_APPLIED` ledger rows. The
  never-captured / no-refund, `PENDING` / no-payment and automatic cancels
  restore at **100%**; the paid path restores the applied slice at the
  cancellation tier (#1164 / D7). Restore idempotency is STRUCTURAL, not
  lock-dependent (#1636): the restore row carries a nullable-unique
  `restoredFromBookingId`, so at most one restore row per booking can exist —
  a duplicate insert is a `skipDuplicates` no-op. This is a restore-specific key, NOT a unique over
  `(sourceBookingId, type=CANCELLATION_REFUND)`, because three legitimate paths
  (`restoreCreditFromBooking`, `createCancellationCredit`'s held-as-credit
  refund, and the Xero inbound late-cash credit) all write that shape for one
  booking. Each branch's atomic status flip remains the primary single-flight (the never-captured and `PENDING` branches claim first under the booking advisory lock), but the unique key removes the cross-path lock-granularity dependence, so moving a credit-restoring path off the shared `lock(1)` can no longer double a restore. The inbound
  credit-note sync leaves a restored booking's ledger alone, alerting instead
  (#3792).
  A CANCELLED booking may legitimately hold consumed credit with NO restore row
  only when its payment captured money (0%-tier paid cancels write no restore
  row; held-as-credit refunds keep the applied rows) or settled without cash
  (the fully-credit-covered $0 SUCCEEDED payment takes the paid path). The daily
  credit-reconciliation cron alerts (no auto-heal) on any CANCELLED
  booking still holding orphaned applied credit, and
  `scripts/backfill-orphaned-applied-credits.ts` heals pre-fix orphans. The
  cancelled-booking delete guard mirrors this: fully-reversed applied credit
  (net-zero, only `BOOKING_APPLIED`/`CANCELLATION_REFUND` rows, no Xero
  credit-note id) no longer blocks deletion, and the coincident
  `payment.creditAppliedCents` mirror is waived with it, while any
  `ADMIN_ADJUSTMENT`/`BOOKING_MODIFICATION_REFUND` row, net-non-zero ledger,
  Xero-linked note, or independently captured/refunded payment still blocks
  (owner decision 2026-07-07, FINAL).

## INV-PAY-020

- A booking confirmation must RECONCILE against the member's own statement when
  account credit paid part of the stay (#2328). Every confirmation carries the
  applied-credit pair beneath the total — `Account credit applied: -$120.00` then
  `Paid by <method>: $180.00` — so `total − credit = settled` is checkable on the
  page. The method is named only where money really changed hands: a stay fully
  covered by credit reads `Nothing more to pay: $0.00`, because the $0
  settlement's Payment row has no source and any method word would be a claim
  the records cannot support; the LINE still renders. "Total Paid" deliberately
  remains the FULL price (the same convention the #2397 rows follow). The figure
  is READ, never re-derived: `loadBookingAppliedCredit` sums the booking's
  `BOOKING_APPLIED` ledger rows — the same `deriveBookingAppliedCreditCents`
  authority the effective-price guards and the #1887 clamp use — and takes the
  settlement wording from the booking's own Payment row, so a bank transfer or a
  manually-recorded cash settlement is never described as a card charge.
  `sendBookingConfirmedEmail` performs the read itself rather than each of its
  send sites threading the figure in, so no site can omit it. Empty-case
  contract: no credit means no rows at all (byte-for-byte unchanged), and a send
  that reports money as NOT yet taken (`paymentDue`) renders no pair. The
  hand-built HTML and the admin-editable `{{creditNote}}` token are built from
  ONE shared row builder (`appliedCreditSummaryRows`), so the two paths cannot
  tell different stories. Money is integer cents throughout.

## INV-PAY-021

- An UNPAID confirmation defers to the INVOICE, and promises nothing about it
  (#2444). The `paymentDue` branch states the booking's own price as `Total Due`
  and asks for an internet-banking transfer, but the document the member pays
  against is the club's invoice, which an admin can adjust by hand. The
  paragraph therefore closes with a CONDITIONAL sentence — "If the invoice asks
  for a different amount — for example because the club has put account credit
  you hold towards it — please transfer the amount the invoice shows". It names
  NO second figure and makes NO Xero read: a transactional confirmation must not
  carry a provider round-trip in its send path. This is the shape sent whenever
  no applicable credit can be stated, and #2483 leaves it unchanged to the byte.
  **The sentence must not promise that credit WILL be applied.** The one send
  site (member whole-lodge approval) has two shapes. Its LEGACY receivable
  (either module off) writes no `MemberCredit` row, so its
  `enqueueXeroAppliedCreditAllocationOperation` call short-circuits and the
  Xero invoice stays at the full price. Its member-choice shape (both modules
  on) mints no receivable and passes `payOnline`: credit the member asked for
  IS applied at approval via `applyCreditToBooking`, so that note nets locally
  (INV-PAY-022), naming no reference and no invoice; the Internet Banking
  switch route raises both, netted, if chosen. The
  sentence is composed by `bookingPaymentDueNote` and rendered from that ONE
  composer by both the hand-built HTML and the `{{paymentDueNote}}` token
  (carried inside `{{paymentOutcome}}`); it rides on an EXISTING token, so an
  override a club saved before #2444 keeps rendering it. Every other money
  outcome is byte-for-byte unchanged.

## INV-PAY-022

- An UNPAID confirmation that DOES carry applied credit states the netting, from
  the club's OWN ledger (#2483; owner decision 2 Aug 2026). Where the booking
  carries `BOOKING_APPLIED` rows the Xero invoice is reduced by exactly that
  credit (allocate-existing, below), so the full price would make the member
  OVERPAY. The `paymentDue` branch renders the reconciling trio — `Booking
  Total`, `Account credit applied`, `Total Due` — from `unpaidMoneySummaryRows`,
  the shared builder both renderers use, and `bookingPaymentDueNote` names the
  netted figure and states the arithmetic in words. `{{totalDue}}` carries the
  NETTED figure; no token was added.
  **The figure is LOCAL by decision, not a guess at Xero.**
  `deriveBookingAppliedCreditCents` is the club's OWN amount-owing law — the same
  figure `prepareManualSettlement` derives an effective price from, the same one
  the card-capture amount guard accepts, and the same `desiredAppliedCents` the
  deallocation engine converges an invoice to.
  **It never asks for a figure the ledger contradicts.**
  `resolveUnpaidCreditNetting` has four outcomes. No credit (or a non-positive
  price) renders the #2444 paragraph unchanged. Credit smaller than the price
  states the trio and asks for the difference. Credit EQUAL to the price states
  `Total Due: $0.00` and asks for nothing (the documented steady state of the
  #1887 reprice clamp). Only credit LARGER than the price refuses, stating no
  figure: `{{totalDue}}` is EMPTY so no saved override can print one, no payment
  reference is quoted, the member is asked to wait, and the sender logs it. A
  failed ledger read fails open to the #2444 paragraph. How that figure relates
  to the allocation gate, which way the closing instruction leans, and the
  admin's whole-lodge invoice email are `INV-PAY-059`.

## INV-PAY-059

- **The netted figure is NOT the predicate the allocation gate reads** (#2483
  review, 2 Aug 2026). `enqueueXeroAppliedCreditAllocationOperation` aggregates
  only the `xeroCreditNoteId: null` UNALLOCATED subset, so the two agree only
  while a stamped row really means the credit is off the LIVE invoice. A hand
  edit in Xero, a FAILED or unprocessed allocation op, and a stamp that outlived
  a re-raised invoice all break that and are #2501's to surface: its checker must
  compare Σ STAMPED `BOOKING_APPLIED` against the live invoice's own allocations,
  not merely club credits against Xero credits.
- **The closing instruction inverts in ONE direction.** #2444 tells the member to
  transfer what the invoice shows; once the email has netted, the netted figure
  stands against an invoice asking for MORE (the invoice may not have been
  reduced yet) but NOT against one asking for LESS, the shape a hand edit in Xero
  produces. Pay the smaller of the two; route the disagreement to the club either
  way.
- **One number, every message on the send site.** With the Xero module OFF there
  is no invoice object and no allocation op, so
  `sendAdminWholeLodgeManualInvoiceEmail` takes the same ledger read and quotes
  the same figure (`wholeLodgeManualInvoiceAmountCents`). The PENDING receivable
  the conversion writes is the booking's price, which equals that figure only
  while the path applies no credit — and the LEGACY branch (either module off)
  still applies none, which the #2328 module guard now pins by position: the
  module's one `applyCreditToBooking` call sits inside the member-choice branch,
  before the legacy mint. The member-choice branch (fork, booking-fixes) writes
  NO receivable at approval, so there is no figure for it to get wrong; the
  receivable is minted later by the Internet Banking switch route at the
  effective price, from the same ledger read, exactly as `booking-create` does.

## INV-PAY-023

- Applied credit reduces the Internet-Banking invoice by ALLOCATING the member's
  EXISTING floating credit notes (#1620, "allocate-existing"; owner decision
  2026-07-08). A member's credit is already represented in Xero as floating
  ACCRECCREDIT notes back-linked to the positive `MemberCredit` row's
  `xeroCreditNoteId`. When credit is applied to an IB booking (create-time or
  switch-to-IB), the raise-path engine (`xero-applied-credit-allocation.ts`, an
  outbox op enqueued after the invoice op) allocates those notes oldest-first
  against the new invoice, up to the applied amount; only the noteless remainder
  is freshly minted. Per-note
  remaining balances live in `MemberCreditNoteAllocation`. The `payment` mirror holds
  `amountCents + creditAppliedCents = finalPriceCents` (net of
  `refundedAmountCents` once a #1765 repay generation exists; the switch path
  derives the applied amount from the `BOOKING_APPLIED` ledger). The engine
  STAMPS the booking's `BOOKING_APPLIED` rows with a representative allocated
  note id LAST — only once the full applied amount is covered — so the #1597
  clearing term is exact. Stated limit, the partial-window residual: a
  concurrent CANCEL treats the credit as unallocated and Xero rejects the excess
  LOUDLY; a concurrent HOLD-EXPIRY settles its clearing note by bank payment and
  over-credits Xero by the already-allocated slice — bookkeeping-only (the 100%
  restore conserves LOCAL money either way), reconciled in Xero. The op's
  idempotent retry (`@@unique(memberCreditId, appliedToBookingId)` + per-row
  completion links) finishes the allocations then stamps; its re-plan reads each
  lot's remaining balance EXCLUDING this booking's own committed rows. A FAILED
  op has no auto FAILED→PENDING reaper; recovery runs through
  `xero-operation-retry.ts`. Cancellation is
  UNCHANGED and still conserves: the 100% restore + `finalPrice − allocated`
  clearing note void the invoice while returning the credit LOCALLY. After a
  cancel of an allocated-credit booking the restored credit is local-only (the
  cancelled invoice consumed its funding note); the local ledger is the source
  of truth and Xero catches up on the next use, via the mint-fresh branch. Goodwill, settled (#2717): only the minted note's
  `ADMIN_ADJUSTMENT` share posts to `goodwillWriteOffs` (EXPENSE, falling back
  to `hutFeeRefunds` while unset, `INV-INT-021`); every other share, restored
  credit included, is the member's own money and stays on `hutFeeRefunds`.
  Noteless is not the accounting question.

## INV-PAY-024

- Applied credit reduces the CARD (Stripe) charge the same way (#1641, owner
  decision 2026-07-08, extending the #1620 engine). The Stripe PaymentIntent is
  minted at the EFFECTIVE amount (`finalPriceCents − Σ BOOKING_APPLIED`, via
  `deriveBookingAppliedCreditCents`; a fully credit-covered booking is confirmed
  at $0 by the create-time zero-dollar path, so the intent route guards
  `effective > 0`). The `Payment` mirror carries `amountCents = effective`,
  `creditAppliedCents = applied`; once a repay generation exists (#1765) the
  mirror aggregates gross captures and the invariant is NET-based:
  `(amountCents − refundedAmountCents) + creditAppliedCents = finalPriceCents`
  at repay settlement. Every capture/reconciliation guard accepts EITHER the
  effective price OR the full `finalPriceCents` and rejects any other amount
  (create-payment-intent reuse, `stripe-webhook-service`,
  `payment-reconciliation`, `confirm-payment`). A full-price capture gives the
  applied credit back (`giveBackAppliedCredit`) and mirrors
  `creditAppliedCents = 0` (#3864). A stored election is spent only once the
  booking's earlier intent is retired (`retireCardIntentBeforeElection`); a live
  capture leaves it unspent. Because a card invoice is raised-and-paid at capture
  (`queueXeroInvoiceForPaidBooking` → `createXeroInvoiceForBooking`), the #1620
  fire-after-invoice outbox op is NOT used on card; `createXeroInvoiceForBooking`
  records the NET captured Stripe cash — gross captures − refunds, capped at the
  invoice's amount due (#1765: settlement evidence is captured-status + positive
  net cash, never `status === "SUCCEEDED"` alone, which misreads a repay-settled PARTIALLY_REFUNDED aggregate; every skip logs a populated reason) — and then SYNCHRONOUSLY
  re-drives the same allocation engine (gated the same way, plus
  `creditAppliedCents > 0`) so the invoice settles to PAID via effective cash +
  credit-note allocation. The allocation throws on failure (the invoice op fails
  and the retry short-circuits on the persisted `xeroInvoiceId`, re-driving the
  idempotent engine without re-creating the invoice). A LEGACY full-price card
  capture (`creditAppliedCents = 0`) is settled in full by cash and does NOT
  allocate; its historical double-pay is repaired by an operator-reviewed LOCAL
  credit restore, enumerated read-only by `auditCardAppliedCreditDoublePays`.

## INV-PAY-025

- A payment landing on an already-CANCELLED booking's stale open invoice must
  never settle silently (#1357). Minting therefore requires positive CASH evidence on the invoice
  (`amountPaid`, falling back to actual payment records), a payment that never
  settled (PENDING/FAILED), and no credit already minted by this pipeline (matched by its own credit descriptions — never by amount, which collides with unrelated cancellation-flow rows). Both
  credit-minting arms (already-cancelled and late-capacity-failure) size the mint
  by the invoice's QUANTIFIED cash (#1459), clamped per payment to the payment's
  own amount — `amountPaid` plus overpayment/prepayment allocations, falling back
  to the invoice's non-DELETED payment records only when `amountPaid` is unusable
  — never by the payment's face amount alone.
  Partially quantifiable evidence floors the mint at the verified cash and the
  alert says the figures are unverified; only evidence that quantifies NOTHING
  falls back to the full payment amount. The mint is also capped PER INVOICE
  (#1505): each arm caps at the invoice's quantified cash MINUS the cash already
  minted for the OTHER Internet Banking payments matched to the same invoice, so
  two never-settled payments on one invoice can never in aggregate mint more
  than the invoice's cash. The remaining-cash figure is read INSIDE each payment's reconcile
  transaction, under the shared advisory lock and excluding the payment's own
  booking, so the cap is idempotent under retry (a replayed payment finds its own credit via the per-booking dedup and mints nothing); an apportioned or fully-exhausted mint raises the same loud admin alert the partial-mint path uses, never a silent overmint. When it mints, the
  inbound reconcile creates the member credit and enqueues the offsetting
  account-credit note — both sized at the minted amount — and retires the
  now-obsolete still-PENDING invoice-clearing refund note, all in ONE
  transaction, then alerts once. Cash arriving AFTER a mint
  never credits automatically; when a later event's fully-verified cash exceeds
  the minted credit the reconcile alerts with the delta, and cash-classified
  evidence that quantifies to zero on a never-settled payment alerts as a payload
  anomaly rather than settling without a credit. A PAID invoice event never
  overwrites a (PARTIALLY_)REFUNDED payment or transaction status back to
  SUCCEEDED.

## INV-PAY-026

- The same cash-evidence rule gates Internet Banking SETTLEMENT itself, not
  just credit minting (#1435), on BOTH inbound settlement surfaces: the
  per-payment loop and the combined group-settlement flip. Settlement runs
  only when the PAID invoice carries positive cash evidence: `amountPaid`
  when present (an explicit 0 is authoritative), falling back to actual
  non-DELETED payment records. Operator-applied OVERPAYMENT and PREPAYMENT
  allocations also count as cash — they are real member money on the Xero
  contact, and the app's own bookkeeping only ever produces credit-note
  allocations, so they can never be the clearing-note echo the gate exists
  to stop. Mixed cash+credit invoices settle (`amountPaid` is the cash
  portion; credit allocations accrue to `amountCredited`). A credit-note-
  cleared invoice settles nothing — no PaymentTransaction or Payment
  SUCCEEDED flip, no booking PAID flip, no member credit, no group-child
  flips; the skip only stamps MISSING invoice identifiers (linkage, never
  status) so a later real-cash event for the same invoice still matches its
  payments, and it alerts the admins when the affected booking is still live
  (an operator cleared the invoice Xero-side while the app still awaits
  payment — nothing else would ever settle or expire that booking). A
  payload carrying NEITHER cash field fails the inbound event instead of
  settling blind or skipping terminally (owner-approved default): the
  FAILED-retry sweep re-fetches the invoice fresh, so transient payload
  degradation self-heals and persistent degradation stays loud and
  operator-replayable. Canonical single-payment identifier backfill remains
  with `syncLinkedPaymentInvoiceMetadata`, which runs before the loop.

## INV-PAY-027

**Related: `INV-PAY-030`**, which puts the same obligation on EXTERNAL provider
side effects — email and Xero as much as money. The two are facets, not
duplicates (#2707, owner decision 9 Aug 2026): this one is about our own money
operations, and neither covers the other's ground. Change one, check the other.

- Payment, refund, and credit operations must be idempotent across retries,
  webhook replays, cron reruns, and partial failure recovery.

## INV-PAY-028

- The Stripe webhook dedup claim (`ProcessedWebhookEvent`) is a processing
  LEASE, not a bare "seen" marker (F16, #1887). The claim carries `status`
  (`PROCESSING`/`COMPLETED`) and `processingStartedAt`. A redelivery hitting an
  existing claim ACKs 200 only when the claim is `COMPLETED`; a `PROCESSING`
  claim still inside the lease window (15 minutes) forces a provider retry
  (HTTP 500) rather than a false-duplicate ACK, and an expired lease (a crashed
  prior attempt) is taken over atomically and reprocessed. A handler failure
  still releases the claim (delete) so the retry re-claims fresh. This closes
  two lost-event windows: a crash between claim-insert and completion, and a
  concurrent redelivery ACKed while the in-flight attempt later fails. Handlers
  stay idempotent, so a lease takeover reprocessing after a crash is safe.

## INV-PAY-029

- A FAILED Stripe payment does not immediately reap the `WAITING_PAYMENT` Xero
  outbox op linked to its intent (F19, #1887). A failed PaymentIntent can be
  retried and SUCCEED on the same intent id, so the reap requires the
  transaction to have stayed FAILED past a 24h grace window
  (`FAILED_TRANSACTION_REAP_GRACE_HOURS`) before cancelling — otherwise a not
  yet-retried failure could be cancelled out from under a same-intent retry that
  is about to succeed, capturing money with no Xero invoice. A retry that
  already succeeded flips the same row to SUCCEEDED and is excluded by the status
  filter; the grace only guards the narrow FAILED→about-to-SUCCEED race. The
  grace is measured on the transaction's `updatedAt`, which is NOT immutable in
  the FAILED state: a redelivered `payment_intent.payment_failed` re-writes
  status=FAILED unconditionally, so `@updatedAt` bumps and the grace restarts.
  This can only DELAY a reap, never trigger one early, and the 14-day
  `createdAt` arm bounds it. Past the grace, whether the op is retired at all is
  `INV-PAY-104`'s question: a decline is not abandonment.

## INV-PAY-104

**Related: `INV-PAY-029`** (when a failed ask is looked at) **and #3403** (the
supersession trigger, an open owner decision this rule deliberately leaves as
it was).

- **A waiting supplementary invoice is retired only when the pay door is
  closed** (#3641). One door, `resolveAdditionalPaymentDoor`
  (`additional-payment-chase.ts`): `closed` when the booking no longer names
  the intent, the intent SUCCEEDED, the booking is deleted or not payable, or
  Stripe says `canceled` or missing; `captured-at-provider` when Stripe has
  the money; else `payable`. The secret route serves only `payable` (404, 409;
  a `processing` intent answers `PAYMENT_PROCESSING`, not paid, #3635); the
  page card asks its booking half. The reaper
  (`xero-waiting-invoice-reaper.ts`) retires only on `closed`, reading Stripe
  only for a FAILED ask (10s, 25 reads a run); a capture Stripe holds but our
  rows never recorded alerts once after three days (`sendAdminAlertOnceEver`,
  so an alert nobody received is retried, #3635).
- **Only a kept capture is invoiced.** `lateCaptureRefundState` answers from
  the #3639 task owning the capture (OPEN undecided, COMPLETED refunded,
  DISMISSED kept, recorded gross: `INV-PAY-110`), else from the booking
  (CANCELLED or a supersede recovery refunds; #3403 unchanged). The reaper and
  `releaseXeroSupplementaryInvoiceForCapturedPaymentIntent` both ask it:
  refunded retires, undecided stays waiting, kept is released or re-queued. An invoice the capture does not cover
  is not issued, and an officer is told. A retired row is re-queued from
  **that row**, the largest ask per change, under
  `lockSupplementaryInvoiceAnchor`, once; it alerts once where another invoice
  is linked or queued. One for the same request (its sent payload keeps
  `paymentIntentId`) covers it, stamped `STALE_WAITING_PAYMENT_COVERED`.

## INV-PAY-030

**Related: `INV-PAY-027`**, which puts the same obligation on OUR OWN payment,
refund and credit operations. The two are facets, not duplicates (#2707, owner
decision 9 Aug 2026): this one is wider than money and reaches every provider
call, so reading it as the money rule twice over drops that coverage. Change
one, check the other.

- External provider side effects require clear retry and idempotency behavior.

## INV-PAY-031

- An organiser-pays group settlement applies only when the payment matches the
  sum of the settleable children **at apply time**, re-verified under the lock
  — a child booking edited while the combined intent/invoice was open must not
  auto-settle at the stale total. Mismatches go to operator review: Stripe
  captures are auto-refunded with an admin alert; paid Internet Banking
  invoices stay PENDING with an admin alert.

## INV-PAY-032

- Committing organiser-pays group children to CONFIRMED before payment has an
  expiry path: the `group-settlement-reaper` cron releases the beds when the
  settlement stays unpaid past its window (never past check-in), voids the
  open intent, and notifies the organiser and joiners — idempotently, and a
  payment that lands first always wins under the shared lock.

## INV-PAY-033

- The reverted children have a terminal path too (#1094): joiners cannot pay
  an organiser-settled booking themselves, so if the FAILED settlement sits
  unretried through a second full reap window the same cron cancels the
  PAYMENT_PENDING children, exactly once, with a joiner notification. A
  settlement retry (which flips the row back to PENDING and resets its clock)
  always keeps the children alive — both are re-checked on the fresh row
  under the shared lock.

## INV-PAY-034

**Related: `INV-PAY-114`**, which supersedes this for a card settlement cancelled after #3653.

- An organiser-cancel group cleanup must be re-drivable after a crash (#1236).
  Cancelling the organiser booking is single-flight, so a re-invoked cancel
  409s and cannot re-enter the joiner cleanup; the `group-settlement-reaper`
  resumes it (an ORGANISER_PAYS group still not CANCELLED under a CANCELLED
  organiser booking, older than a short grace). The per-child refund plan
  (`{childId: cents}`) persisted on the settlement is the **record of record**
  for the organiser-settled per-child `refundedAmountCents` mirror: a re-drive
  **reconstructs it verbatim and never recomputes** — a >24h re-drive can land
  in a different cancellation tier, so recomputing the mirror amount would be
  unsafe. The plan is written before the Stripe refund and before the
  settlement flips, so the refund fires at most once across re-drives.

## INV-PAY-035

- Organiser cancellation is a durable settlement fence (#1881). It writes the
  group `CANCELLED` under global `lock(1)` before any provider call or child
  cleanup. Settlement apply re-reads that fence under the same lock and cannot
  promote children afterward. If settlement won first, cancellation observes
  the paid state and arms/refunds the frozen plan; if cancellation won first, a
  late Stripe capture is auto-refunded as superseded and a late paid Xero invoice
  is left unapplied with an operator alert. Child cancellation is status-guarded.
  The resume cron finds fenced groups by remaining active organiser-settled
  children, not by requiring the group status to remain open.
  Settlement initiation checks the fence both at entry and again under global
  `lock(1)` before child-lodge locks; neither Stripe nor Internet Banking may
  create fresh provider work for a cancelled group. Internet Banking settlement
  creation commits its settlement row and Xero outbox row atomically. The Xero
  worker also shares `lock(1)`: it skips provider work when cancellation was
  already fenced, and if cancellation commits while `createInvoices` is outside
  the transaction, it durably records the returned invoice identity, voids that
  invoice with a stable idempotency key, suppresses invoice email, and leaves a
  failed outbox operation retryable when compensation fails.

## INV-PAY-036

**Related: `INV-PAY-114`**, which supersedes this for a card settlement cancelled after #3653.

- The group-cancel refund credit-note enqueue is **durable** (#1257/#1377).
  Each child's Xero refund credit-note outbox row (integer cents) is enqueued
  **inside the same transaction** as that child's cancel + `refundedAmountCents`
  mirror — the enqueue is a DB outbox insert, not a provider call, so it may
  join the tx. A crash can therefore never leave a `CANCELLED` child with its
  refund mirror written but no credit-note operation queued: either both commit
  or neither does (the reaper then re-drives the still-`ACTIVE` child). This
  closes the window for **every** payment source, including Internet-Banking
  children the #1354 daily reconcile self-heal cannot recover because they carry
  no per-child `xeroInvoiceId`; that daily self-heal remains a Stripe-only
  backstop. Only the outbox worker *kick* stays best-effort and post-commit.

## INV-PAY-037

**Related: `INV-PAY-114`**, which supersedes this for a card settlement cancelled after #3653.

- A failed settlement refund must stay durably owed (#1351): the frozen plan
  is never nulled, a payment-recovery operation persisted before the inline
  Stripe call retries the refund under the same
  `group_cancel_refund_<settlementId>` key, and no interleaving of the inline
  run, the recovery replay, and the reaper resume may apply a per-child
  refund mirror twice — the replay only ever writes a mirror to an
  already-CANCELLED plan child whose `refundedAmountCents` is still zero,
  via a conditional update. Alerts fire on retry exhaustion only.

## INV-PAY-114

**Related: `INV-PAY-034`, `INV-PAY-036`, `INV-PAY-037`** (the legacy and
Internet Banking path) and **`INV-PAY-103`** (the one card-refund writer).

- **A child the organiser paid for by card is refunded out of the group's
  combined payment, one Stripe refund per child, and nothing is called
  refunded until Stripe answered** (#3653). An Internet Banking child keeps
  the ordinary options.
  - **The debt is written first**, under `lock(1)`: one
    `PaymentRecoveryOperation` per refund, keyed `organiser_child_refund_*`,
    amount frozen, counted against the child's payment and the combined
    capture. An edit over it is refused; a cancellation
    clamps.
  - **One disposition, the organiser's card**: no account credit for an edit,
    a joiner's own cancel or a consent lapse. Every edit door, quote and
    review charge refuses a price increase.
  - **The record waits for Stripe.** The `PaymentRefund` (no transaction),
    mirror, Xero refund note, settlement status and close commit in one
    `lock(1)` transaction; the edit door raises no modification note. A replay
    first finds Stripe's refund by key.
  - **What has gone back** is the larger of the mirror and the child's
    refund rows (`organiserChildRefundedCents`). A cancellation, organiser's or joiner's,
    tiers what remains less refunds owed through `cancelRefundableBaseCents`
    ([INV-PAY-018]); the organiser's freezes `{ perChildRefunds }`. A joiner's
    cancel after a reduction takes the paid path; behind the group's it (and
    its preview) refunds nothing more; its frozen figures follow the final amount. A
    pre-#3653 `{childId: cents}` plan and an Internet Banking settlement keep
    `INV-PAY-034`-`037`.
  - **Only Stripe evidence raises a child's mirror**: the Xero
    credit-note repair never takes it past the child's recorded refunds.
  - **A pending refund that fails** is taken back out by the payments cron
    and its debt reopened, marked for the recovery audit, due after Stripe's
    key window.

## INV-PAY-105

**Related: `INV-PAY-031`** (children total at apply) and **`INV-PAY-035`**
(the cancellation VOID).

- An organiser-pays group settlement is **bound** to its combined Internet
  Banking invoice while it waits for it (`isGroupSettlementBoundToInvoice`)
  (#3642) until it is paid, replaced, cancelled or lapses. It is never
  switched to card.
- **A change to the group replaces the invoice** (orchestrator decision under
  the issue's item 1, which allowed refuse-or-replace). The invoice is read in
  Xero first: with no payment or credit it is retired and a new one raised at
  the new total; with any money on it nothing changes and the operators are
  alerted. A claim for a moved invoice rolls back under `lock(1)`. Asking
  again unchanged returns the same invoice and keeps the reaper's clock.
- An invoice is bound only to the current attempt at the settlement's total;
  anything else is abandoned on arrival: VOID queued, pointer cleared, link
  kept inactive.
- **Money on an invoice is never walked away from.** An invoice with any
  payment or credit is not voided, not released (the group keeps
  its beds, the owner's #3643 rule) and not replaced; each alerts once per
  kind. One Xero cannot show is held, with an alert, up to seven days past the
  deadline; one Xero does not have is never voided. A started stay with an
  invoice is never released, whatever Xero shows ([INV-PAY-016]). Joiner
  prices that cannot make the invoice release the binding and alert. A paid
  invoice settles the group only for the settlement's total read under
  `lock(1)` while it is still the settlement's invoice; a card capture only
  while the settlement is still on that intent (otherwise it is refunded).

total at apply).

- **Once an organiser-pays group's settlement is paid, the organiser is never
  billed for anyone else, and nobody is left unsettleable** (#3672, owner
  option B). A member who joins afterwards gets an ordinary member-pays
  booking. The payer is decided by `organiserPaysForNewJoiner`
  (`src/lib/group-late-joiner.ts`) and re-decided under `lock(1)` when the
  booking is written.
- "Paid" is SUCCEEDED or PARTIALLY_REFUNDED, defined once in
  `src/lib/group-organiser-paid.ts` for the server and the organiser's card.
  REFUNDED is unpaid. On a live group PARTIALLY_REFUNDED cannot occur (only
  the organiser cancel writes it, after CANCELLED), so the settle paths'
  SUCCEEDED-only replay guards give the same answer.
- **Every live, unpaid organiser-settled joiner the paid bill missed is
  switched to member-pays**, started stay or not, in the transaction that
  marks the settlement paid. Each switch writes a payer-switch booking event
  in that transaction. The group-settlement reaper applies the same switch
  to any paid group still holding one, under `lock(1)`.
- Who is told: a `PAYMENT_PENDING` joiner whose stay has not started
  (`bookingStayHasStarted`, the club's today) is emailed to pay, at most
  once. A started stay is not emailed; the treasurer is alerted once per
  group, linking each joiner's booking. The claim (`sendAdminAlertOnceEver`)
  is kept once an admin has it or a copy is queued for the email retry cron,
  held a day when no admin can receive it, and given back only when the send
  throws first. The
  reaper retries it from the events of stays not yet ended.

## INV-PAY-051

- **An unpriceable booking edit holds the money as an explicit typed review, and
  one occurrence is one task** (#3030, epic #2797, owner decisions D1-D3). When a
  valid structural edit's exact adjustment cannot be read from the booking's own
  stored sold-price evidence, the stay change completes and the money becomes an
  OPEN `ManualRefundTask` of kind `EDIT_FINANCIAL_REVIEW`. `amountCents` NULL
  means the amount is genuinely unknown and `0` may never be used to mean it;
  `paymentId` records the booking's captured money AT RAISE TIME and nothing
  backfills it; since #3194 the completion re-reads the booking's own payment
  and routes on that. Identity is the `occurrenceKey`, minted only by
  `editFinancialReviewOccurrenceKey`
  (`src/lib/edit-financial-review-occurrence.ts`), never a `reason` sentence, so
  a replay of one edit raises one task, covering the edit ([INV-PAY-067]). Completion carries the
  admin's confirmed POSITIVE integer cents plus a note, written inside the same
  status-guarded claim as the status so it cannot apply twice; a figure differing
  from one the task already held is the audited amendment D2 permits on this
  kind alone, `raisedAmountCents` preserving what it was raised with.
  DISMISSED means reviewed and this system moved no money, and writes no amount;
  its REQUIRED note says whether nothing was owed or the club settled it outside
  the task. Nothing moves at Stripe, in the ledger, in Xero or as account credit

  `INV-PAY-062`, `INV-PAY-070`, `INV-PAY-063`, `INV-PAY-071`, `INV-PAY-064` and
  `INV-PAY-072`; the refund legs and the anchor `INV-PAY-065`; the fence and

- **Late cash on a cancelled ORGANISATION-owned booking raises a hand-back task,
  never account credit** (#3369): an organisation has no ledger, so the money
  sits on the payments board and an admin is told.

## INV-PAY-067

- **One task per parked EDIT, carrying every strand it records, and the
  DEPARTING strand is always one of them** (#3032; the grain moved from the
  strand to the edit in #3498, owner decision D1). The occurrence key is minted
  over the whole edit — the lead strand's identity material plus every other
  recorded strand's, sorted so the planner's read order cannot change it — so a
  replay re-derives the same key and creates nothing, while a genuinely different
  edit that happens to present the same lead strand does not collide with it.
  WHICH strands are recorded is unchanged: a remaining strand is recorded when
  its own rows cannot be read, and the strand actually leaving is recorded on
  every parked removal, whether or not its own rows read cleanly, because the
  delete destroys the guest's night rows. Where that strand's rows ARE exact its
  cause is `COUNTERPART_STRAND_UNREADABLE`, its stored evidence carries the real
  per-night prices, and no `amountCents` is written, because the money that goes
  back also depends on the cancellation tier and the promo recalculation a parked
  removal skips. **No stored figure may be lost when the grain moves**: every
  field a per-strand record carried is still recorded, on the lead strand or in
  the occurrence's strand list, and
  `edit-financial-review-strand-census.test.ts` fails by name when one is
  dropped. The item LEADS with the strand whose night set the edit moves —
  unreadable before readable, and a guest id as the tie-break so the choice is a
  pure function of the strand set — because that is the strand the money hangs
  on, and a card that led with any of the others is the near-miss #3498 was filed
  for. **A parked edit never destroys a number
  the system could have known.**

## INV-PAY-100

- **One work item holds one amount, so the GRAIN follows how many strands' nights
  the edit moved** (#3498; owner decision 17 September 2026). At most one mover,
  one item for the whole edit; two or more, one item per recorded strand, each
  single-strand and carrying no `otherStrands`.
  `editFinancialReviewStrandMovesNights` is the one definition of "moved", and
  the same one that picks the lead. No evidence is lost either way: the set of
  items records every strand exactly once, and two items of one edit hash to two
  keys because the lead material differs.
- **The settled amount moves AT MOST ONE strand's stored worth: the strand the
  item LEADS with, and only where the edit moved that strand's nights.**
  `RepairableStrand.absorbsSettlement` is that answer, derived once on the server
  and applied by the settle screen and the completion alike. Every other strand
  must come to its own stored total exactly. **FALSE FOR EVERY STRAND is an
  ordinary answer**: on a parked removal the departing guest leads and offers no
  blanks, so the refund moves nothing, and treating "the first strand with boxes"
  as the answer would move a stranger's stay by somebody else's money. A pure
  guest add moves no existing strand, so its lead absorbs nothing either.
  Spreading an amount across strands is an allocation nobody stated, which
  `INV-MOD-028` forbids.
- Why the fan-out rather than an allocation screen, and what it costs, is argued
  on #3498; `parkedEditWorkItems` states the mechanism. Pinned by
  `stored-night-price-repair-multi-strand.test.ts` and
  `edit-financial-review-strand-census.test.ts`.

## INV-PAY-101

- **A Xero refund or credit document names how the money went back, from the
  settlement decision — never inferred from the payment's source** (#3529;
  owner wording, 20 September 2026). Three refund wordings head the line
  description and reference: *Refund against original credit card*, *Refund
  requested via internet banking*, *Account Credit*; a fourth, [INV-PAY-017]'s
  unpaid-invoice clearing, names no refund. Their one home is
  `src/lib/xero-refund-method.ts`, censused over `src/lib`.
- **The method travels with the decision.** The cancel path's `refundMethod`,
  the edit-review route (`refundMethodForEditReviewRoute`: card → card,
  hand-settled → internet banking, credit → account credit) and the hand-back
  completion carry it into the outbox payload; the builder records it on the
  operation, so a retry or repair settles the same way. Only a row carrying
  none reads the source (`defaultRefundMethodForPaymentSource`); the
  unapplied-note builder is account credit by construction.
- **Xero records a settling payment only where the money verifiably moved**
  (owner decision, 20 September 2026). A card refund's credit-note payment
  posts to `stripeBankAccount`, capped by cash evidence (`INV-PAY-050`). A
  recorded bank-transfer refund posts to
  `bankTransferRefundAccount` (an `INV-INT-021` key whose while-unset answer
  is a behaviour, not a fallback key) once chosen, and is otherwise left
  UNSETTLED, visibly outstanding for the bank-feed match; a method nobody
  recorded stays unsettled whatever is configured. Never the Stripe account
  for a transfer: a wrong-account payment hides the note as paid.
  `resolveRefundSettlement` is the one reading, shared by the inline and
  repair legs; a note skipped by design (`refundPaymentSkipped`) is never
  re-repaired.
- **On a cancelled booking a completed `CANCELLED_BOOKING_HAND_BACK`, and a
  review's netted card refund or hand-back (#3880), raise
  the cancellation's refund note** against the invoice's id,
  never `hasIssuedPrimaryXeroInvoice` (false here); a cash settlement
  (#2262) has none. Cancellation policy is untouched (D2,
  #3527). Pinned by
  `xero-refund-method-documents.test.ts`, `manual-refund-task.test.ts`,

  `edit-financial-review-cancelled-refund-xero.realdb.test.ts`.

## INV-PAY-060

- **A SETTLED occurrence does not suppress the next one of the same identity**
  (#3166). A replay collapses into an OPEN task and only an OPEN task; a
  COMPLETED or DISMISSED row at the same key means a person already answered
  that question, so the raise walks past it onto a `#n` recurrence key and writes
  a new OPEN task. The RAISE never reopens, amends or re-keys a settled row;
  reopening is an officer's own audited act and only from DISMISSED
  ([INV-PAY-099]). A
  replay cannot see a terminal row: the raise runs inside the caller's
  transaction, and a new edit reaches the raise only after
  `assertNoPendingEditFinancialReview` has confirmed nothing on the booking is
  OPEN. Pinned by `edit-financial-review.test.ts` and
  `edit-financial-review-races.realdb.test.ts`.
- **A stored night price is not proof of a sold price, which is why a human
  prices this.** Two backfill migrations (`20260704150000`, #1098;
  `20260810010000`) populated `BookingGuestNight.priceCents` by dividing a stored
  guest total by the night count, and nothing in the schema tells such a row
  apart from a genuinely-sold one. The evidence captured in `reviewContext`
  records what the database HELD and claims no more. Separating derived rows from
  sold ones is #3031's.
- **An OPEN task may carry an amount.** The raise may write a figure to both
  `amountCents` and `raisedAmountCents`; `priced-but-still-OPEN` means *the edit
  could prove a figure and a human has not yet confirmed it*. Money moves only on
  a COMPLETED transition, whatever the row already holds.

## INV-PAY-068

- **A completion at zero is refused, and the refusal names the way out.** `0`
  means the club handed nothing back, so COMPLETED at `0` would assert a refund
  that did not happen, and `booking-narrative.ts` selects a cancelled booking's
  settlement event by TYPE without filtering on amount. "Reviewed, nothing is
  due" is DISMISSED. The owner re-decided this on 31 Aug 2026 (#3195 question 1)
  and kept it; **a bare refusal is not compliant** — the sentence must name the
  action in the officer's own screen's words ("no adjustment" on a financial
  review, "dismiss" on a legacy hand-back). `zeroCompletionRefusal` is the one
  home for both sentences; the admin route's schema no longer rejects a zero
  because it cannot know which control to name, and the settle screen reads the
  same refusal.

- The rest of this rule, in order: the withheld-share dismiss-only rule `INV-PAY-096`; its idempotency, its deploy sequencing, and the credit-only completion `INV-PAY-097`.

## INV-PAY-096

_Split from `INV-PAY-068` (#3213, PR #3309)._

- **A share the edit's invoice was mid-send for becomes a DISMISS-ONLY queue
  item, and nothing bills it** (#3213, owner decision 4 Sep 2026). When a
  settled share cannot be added to its edit's Xero invoice because that invoice
  has been picked up for sending, no second invoice is raised: a claimed job
  can still return to the queue and go out at the full amount, so raising one
  now could bill the member twice. The share becomes a
  `UNCOLLECTED_EDIT_REVIEW_SHARE` task an officer closes deliberately, and
  closing it is DISMISSED - the completion door refuses `COMPLETED` on this
  kind outright, because `settlementDirection` NULL reads as `REFUND_TO_MEMBER`
  on every kind older than `EDIT_FINANCIAL_REVIEW` and a completion would
  therefore assert a refund the club never made and reach the allocation path.
  `amountCents` NULL is legal here and means the missing amount is genuinely
  unknowable - the payment-recovery replay holds the edit's combined total and
  cannot say which part the sent invoice carried - so `0` may no more be used
  for it than on a review, and the settled TOTAL may not be substituted, which
  would tell an officer to bill money already asked for.

## INV-PAY-097

_Split from `INV-PAY-068` (#3213, PR #3309). "The kind" below is
`UNCOLLECTED_EDIT_REVIEW_SHARE`, defined in `INV-PAY-096`._

- **One withheld share
  is one item**: the kind mints an `occurrenceKey` and
  `ManualRefundTask_edit_review_occurrence_key_present` refuses a row of this
  kind without one, because the unique index exempts NULL and a writer that
  omitted the key would raise a fresh item on every replay - the officer would
  be told twice to check one booking and could bill it twice. The accepted
  trade is that the item is *visible and actionable*, never self-resolving:
  closing it is a person's act. **Registered in one release and written in the next**
  (migration `20260910010000`), because the previously deployed colour cannot
  deserialize the label and the finance queue selects `kind` over every OPEN
  row; `uncollected-edit-review-share-expand.test.ts` holds that line.

- **A credit-only completion records no refund.** Where the booking has no
  captured money, `Payment.refundedAmountCents` is untouched and no `REFUNDED`
  booking event is written — that log is member-facing. Since #3032 such a
  completion does ISSUE account credit and records `CREDITED` after the commit;
  since #3194 that branch is reached by asking the BOOKING at completion rather
  than reading the frozen `ManualRefundTask.paymentId`.

## INV-PAY-061

- **A confirmed amount is settled through the settlement path that already
  exists, never a fourth one** (#3032). The booking's payment decides which: a
  canonical Stripe refund for a card capture, made AFTER the commit; the local
  ledger allocation for an internet-banking hand-back; or
  `createBookingModificationCredit` where nothing was captured, whose
  exactly-once key is the `BookingModification` id; there a share is first
  applied credit given back (`INV-PAY-113`). **Which one is a question
  about the booking, asked at completion** (#3194): a task carrying no payment id
  re-reads the booking's own payment through `editReviewSettlementPayment`, the
  single derivation the raise sites use too (`editReviewSettlementPaymentId`). A
  task that DOES carry a payment id is still routed by that id, because the
  stored id reaches routes the live row no longer would (a reversed manual
  settlement, a booking that has left the settled statuses) where the amount is
  capped and an over-cap is REFUSED with the task left OPEN. The re-read writes
  nothing, so a replayed capture or webhook cannot produce a second refund. A
  matching Xero modification credit note is queued on the same anchor through
  `queueXeroBookingEditSettlement`, the choke point the three booking-edit
  services use. The route is chosen and every refusal raised BEFORE the status
  claim, so a refused completion leaves the task OPEN; the Stripe route writes
  no allocation of its own, because `refundPaymentTransactions` writes it. The
  completion holds no advisory lock across the Stripe call (since #3582 its
  `lock(1)` is taken and released inside the transaction;
  `docs/CONCURRENCY_AND_LOCKING.md`), so the status claim is the whole
  single-flight guarantee across it.

## INV-PAY-113

- **A review share on a booking with nothing captured is that booking's applied
  credit coming back, once** (#3791, owner decisions of 2 October 2026; Xero
  per the orchestrator's reading of decision 1).
  - **One give-back.** `giveBackAppliedCredit` (`member-credit.ts`) is the
    clamp's mechanism, the share's and, since #3809, a credit-paid booking's
    price reduction's (`INV-MOD-011`): the credit-ledger lock, the
    deallocation fence, a positive `BOOKING_APPLIED` row (a review's names the
    booking in `sourceBookingId`) and the deallocation of an invoice's excess
    allocated credit (bank transfer or card, #3809). The share lowers the mirror a cancellation tiers.
  - **Xero agrees with the app**, for an issued invoice: invoice less its
    reduction notes is the booking's price, Xero's due is the app's owed, and
    the member's Xero credit, counting noteless rows minted when spent, is the
    app's. So an invoice-ALLOCATED note takes off the whole reduction
    (`reviewInvoiceReductionCents`); minted credit takes the unallocated note;
    a cancelled booking is left alone except for that minted note. Notes are
    scoped to the review task and wait for the deallocation, failing for an
    operator retry when it FAILED. A captured payment's share keeps the
    document rule.
  - **The ledger posts what was returned**, none at zero; on a covered booking
    the give-back beyond the re-price is an agreed reduction no re-price
    reverses (`agreedGiveBackKey`).
  - **Unpaid** - credit short of the price beyond earlier review give-backs:
    no more given back than the booking's review re-prices removed.
  - **Cancelled first**, every route (#3835): netted cumulatively against
    the cancellation, by what its CANCELLED event froze (tier method, bases,
    `INV-PAY-115`'s cap, earlier reviews); refused, task OPEN, where the tier
    does not reproduce it. Untiered money goes first; the capture gets only
    its part. $200, $50 share: $200, $105, $50 back at 100%, 50% less $20, 0%.

## INV-PAY-115

- **A cancellation tiers applied credit capped at what the booking is now worth,
  money paid first - for a booking reduced through #3809's settlement** (owner
  decision A: credit-paid members are treated the same as card-paid ones). The
  card slice's base caps money paid at price plus change fee
  (`cancelRefundableBaseCents`); the credit slice is what the same cap leaves of
  the applied credit (`cancelAppliedCreditBaseCents`), tiered by
  `calculateAppliedCreditRestore`. $200 credit-paid, $5 back on a $50 reduction
  at 50% less $20, then a cancel at the same tier restores $55: $60 in all, the
  card-paid figure.
  - **Only new reductions** (owner decision, 4 Oct 2026, "Cap new reductions
    only"): the cap applies where an edit's history row records the settlement
    of applied credit (`bookingReducedThroughCreditGiveBack`,
    `BookingModification.newData`). A booking reduced before that release tiers
    all the credit still applied, as before: never short, and up to about $20
    more than an all-card member at partial tiers. No data change.
  - **A captured payment the cancel cannot refund** - a reduction refunded the
    card whole - has its credit tiered the same way, with no card slice, not
    restored whole (`refundedPaymentCreditRestore`), on a booking reduced
    through that settlement. Before it, or never captured, it is restored
    whole, as on main.
  - The executed cancel, the member's preview and the review's netting
    (`INV-PAY-113`) use one base; the CANCELLED event freezes it
    (`appliedCreditBaseCents`), capped or not. Credit kept above the cap counts
    as kept beyond the policy (design §5.1).

## INV-PAY-069

- **A completion states WHICH WAY the money goes, and the row records it**
  (#3170, owner decision 30 Aug 2026). `ManualRefundTaskDirection` is written
  into `settlementDirection` inside the same status-guarded claim as the amount,
  and the amount stays a POSITIVE magnitude on both directions — the sign of a
  money value is never overloaded to mean a direction. An `EDIT_FINANCIAL_REVIEW`
  completion that states no direction is refused before the claim; silence on a
  legacy kind means `REFUND_TO_MEMBER`, and `CHARGE_TO_MEMBER` on one is refused
  outright. A dismissal records no direction.
- **The charging direction is the additional-payment path, not a new mechanism**
  (#3170). A `CHARGE_TO_MEMBER` completion re-enters
  `createModificationAdditionalPaymentIntent` — the same function every ordinary
  booking-edit price increase goes through — so the instrument, the PENDING
  `ADDITIONAL` `PaymentTransaction`, the chase reminders, the member's pay link
  and the Xero supplementary invoice's wait-for-payment are the existing ones.
  NOTHING IS TAKEN FROM THE CARD BY THE COMPLETION: it raises the request and the
  member pays it. A booking with neither a captured card payment nor an issued
  Xero invoice is REFUSED before the claim, with the task left OPEN. The Xero leg
  is the same choke point with a POSITIVE `priceDiffCents`, the only place the
  direction becomes a sign.

## INV-PAY-062

- **ONE BOOKING EDIT RAISES ONE CHARGE REQUEST, for the total of its shares**
  (#3170, owner decision 30 Aug 2026). One edit raises one review task per guest
  strand whose history could not be read, and an officer may settle both as
  money owed; two separate requests LOSE MONEY, because minting an additional
  PaymentIntent queues every OTHER outstanding `ADDITIONAL` transaction for
  cancellation and `reconcilePaymentAggregates` carries a single
  `additionalAmountCents`. So:
  - **The REQUEST is anchored to the `BookingModification`** — one intent, one
    `ADDITIONAL` row, one figure on the member's pay link — and BOTH the Stripe
    idempotency key and the recovery operation are scoped to it. The Stripe key
    also names the AMOUNT (#3371): the figure is re-derived each attempt, and
    Stripe refuses a key reused with different parameters. A later share RAISES
    that intent's amount rather than minting a second. (The REFUND keys stay
    TASK-scoped: two refunds of one edit are two movements that must never
    converge.)
  - **The SHARE stays anchored to the task** — its `amountCents`,
    `settlementDirection` and audit entry — so the combined figure remains
    explainable.
  - **The total is DERIVED from the settled shares, never incremented.** Each
    task contributes exactly once, from the row its own status-fenced claim
    wrote; whichever completion commits LAST derives the true total, and
    **neither leg may LOWER what is recorded**. On the Stripe leg two runs are
    ordered by a claim, not a lock ([INV-PAY-112]).
    A balance CARRIED IN from another edit ([INV-PAY-098]) is stored apart, so
    the sum stays monotone and the refusal stays correct.
  - **A share may not be added to a request the member has already paid, or to
    one whose supplementary invoice has already been issued.** Both are REFUSED
    before the claim with the task left OPEN. The Xero leg is `INV-PAY-070`.

## INV-PAY-099

- **A DISMISSED money task may be put back on the queue; a COMPLETED one may
  not** (#3498, owner decision D2). A dismissal is a DECISION — reviewed, and
  this system moved no money for that occurrence — and a decision can be wrong;
  before this it was terminal, the queue read only `status: "OPEN"`, and the
  unique `occurrenceKey` meant the occurrence was never raised again, so a wrong
  dismissal was silent, permanent and invisible to every later reader. A
  completion is a MOVEMENT, settled against an anchor that enforces exactly-once
  ([INV-PAY-065]), so reopening one would invite a second pricing the database
  then refuses — it is refused by status, before anything is claimed. A
  dismissal with no `completedByMemberId` is refused as well: those are the
  Stripe webhook's own records of a capture it had already refunded
  ([INV-ADDPAY-037]), and putting one in the hand-settle queue would invite a
  second refund of money that has gone back. The transition is the same
  status-fenced conditional update the closure uses in the other direction, it
  moves no money and calls no provider, and it clears `completedAt` and
  `completedByMemberId` while leaving the dismissal's own `note` as the officer
  wrote it. The reopen is audited as
  `booking-payment.manual-refund-task.reopen` with a REQUIRED note, carrying who
  dismissed the row, when, and what they said — the claim clears all three from
  the row, so that entry is the only place they survive. Reopening re-arms
  everything the OPEN status governs, including the pending-review fence
  ([INV-PAY-066]) and the member-facing banner. Home:

  `manual-refund-task-reopen.test.ts`.

## INV-PAY-098

- **A REPLACEMENT ASK CARRIES THE UNPAID BALANCE OF THE ONE IT RETIRES, AND
  RECORDS WHAT IT CARRIED** (#3371, owner decision 13 Sep 2026). Minting an
  ADDITIONAL PaymentIntent cancels every other live one on the payment
  ([INV-ADDPAY-023]). [INV-PAY-047] sizes an ordinary edit's ask accordingly; a
  settled review's charge is the SAME rule over its own figure, that edit's
  settled shares ([INV-PAY-062]). Until #3371 it passed the bare sum, deleting
  an earlier change's unpaid extra.
  - **The carried amount is its own stored fact**,
    `PaymentTransaction.carriedAskCents`, and is a PART of `amountCents`, never
    an addition. Once the retired row is cancelled nothing can derive it, so
    recording it is provenance, not duplication.
  - **It never joins the derived share total.** [INV-PAY-062]'s refuse-to-lower
    rule is safe only because that sum never decreases, and that monotonicity is
    why this path can refuse a stale lowering with no lock across a provider
    call ([`CONCURRENCY_AND_LOCKING.md`](../CONCURRENCY_AND_LOCKING.md)). Two
    concurrent raises are ordered by [INV-PAY-112]'s claim, not by it.
  - **A later share reads it off the row, never off the payment**, which mirrors
    this request by then.
  - **The accounting leg never sees it.** [INV-PAY-070] bills one invoice per
    edit, and this is not that edit's money, so every figure handed to that leg
    has the carried part taken out.
  - **The obligation is structural.** `AdditionalAsk`
    (`src/lib/additional-payment-ask.ts`) is a module-private class holding the
    carried part in a `#private` field, so it can be neither built nor spread
    apart elsewhere; every constructor of a positive ask takes the payment being
    retired or the row being raised; and the minter accepts nothing else. No type
    refuses a deliberate assertion, so the call-site census refuses it.
  - **A FAILED mint carries nothing**: it retired nothing, so the earlier ask is
    still live for the replay to read.

## INV-PAY-112

- **ONE EDIT'S CHARGE REQUEST IS RAISED BY ONE RUN AT A TIME** (#3402). Refusing
  to lower ([INV-PAY-062]) orders nothing between two runs that each derive more
  than is stored: both raised the intent, and the LAST to land won even when it
  was smaller.
  - **Claim before the provider call.** A run must win the edit's
    `EditReviewChargeRaiseClaim` lease and record its intended amount under that
    exact token before ANY Stripe call. A loser calls nothing, arms the edit's
    recovery row and reports `deferred`, which never closes a replay.
  - **Release, then look again**, raising for a share that committed meanwhile.
    After `already-paid` the holder looks again only if the recovery row is
    dead, so each uncollected total is audited ONCE, and a paid request covering
    every share not at all. A lease lost after a provider call reports
    `deferred`, never `raised`.
  - **The backstop runs.** Arming reopens a SUCCEEDED recovery row; the replay's
    close and hand-back are fenced on its retry time and exact attempt. A
    terminal FAILED row is not reopened (`INV-PAY-057`).
  - **The raise writes amounts, never status**, onto a live, uncaptured
    ADDITIONAL row only: a webhook landing mid-raise stands, and a declined
    request KEEPS FAILED (still owed, still payable).
  - **A lease, never a lock**: nothing is held across Stripe and no advisory key
    is taken; an expired token is taken over, safe because the derived total
    only grows and a raise is absolute.
  - **Stated limits**, ordering and interleavings:

## INV-PAY-070

- **The Xero leg bills the TOTAL, on ONE invoice per edit, enforced rather than
  assumed** (#3170). A share arriving while this edit's supplementary invoice
  operation is still PENDING or WAITING_PAYMENT RAISES that operation's amount
  rather than queueing a second invoice. `enqueueXeroSupplementaryInvoiceOperation`
  decides link-check → queued-check → write inside ONE transaction holding
  `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext("xero-supplementary-invoice"),
  hashtext(<anchor>))`, and looks for an outstanding invoice by ANCHOR rather
  than by the amount-derived correlation key — the active `SUPPLEMENTARY_INVOICE`
  link exists only once the FIRST invoice exists, so before that it fences
  nothing.
- **A restate that WRITES is a restate that goes out.**
  `processQueuedXeroOutboxOperations` re-reads `requestPayload` after its claim
  commits; RUNNING is outside the restatable set, so a restate either lands and
  is sent or matches nothing and reports zero, with no third outcome; it names
  each settled share as a line (`INV-MOD-058`).
- **What the accounting leg does NOT guarantee.** A restate can arrive too
  late to land AT ALL — once the worker has claimed the operation it is
  RUNNING, and once the invoice has been sent the anchor carries an active
  `SUPPLEMENTARY_INVOICE` link. The enqueue then refuses a second
  invoice behind the first and RECORDS the shortfall:
  `outcome: "short-sent"` when the invoice exists, `"short-in-flight"` when the
  worker has merely claimed the row. What happens next is `INV-PAY-063`.
- **AND A SUPERSEDED EDIT'S INVOICE CAN BE ORPHANED** (#3371 review round;
  pre-existing since #3340). A card booking's supplementary invoice waits
  `WAITING_PAYMENT` on its own PaymentIntent, released only by a confirmed
  payment on it. A later mint CANCELS that intent ([INV-ADDPAY-023]), so it is
  never released and `reapStaleWaitingPaymentXeroOutboxOperations` retires it a
  day later — while the replacement ask still COLLECTS that money
  ([INV-PAY-098]). The backstop is the booking-vs-Xero repair pass's
  `MISSING_SUPPLEMENTARY_INVOICE`. Folding the carried balance onto the
  replacement's invoice is NOT the repair: it double-bills wherever the earlier
  invoice DID issue.

## INV-PAY-063

- **A recorded shortfall is BILLED, ON A SECOND SEPARATE INVOICE — not collected
  by hand** (#3193, owner decision 31 Aug 2026). **No invoice already in a
  member's hands is altered or voided.** This NARROWS "one booking edit, one ask"
  (`INV-PAY-062`) without overturning it: while the change's invoice is still in
  the queue a later share RAISES it and the member is asked once; only once the
  invoice has been SENT does the difference become its own ask. The cost — two
  requests for one change in that narrow window — was accepted knowingly.
- **ONLY A SENT INVOICE BUYS A SECOND ASK.** `short-sent` is durable evidence: an
  active `SUPPLEMENTARY_INVOICE` link means an invoice exists and what it bills
  can never change. `short-in-flight` is NOT evidence: a claimed row can return
  to PENDING un-attempted (by exactly one route, a process-global Xero cooldown
  refusal), the NEXT settlement then raises that row to the COMBINED total, and
  the change-anchored restate cannot see a second ask anchored elsewhere. So
  `short-in-flight` raises nothing and takes the recorded-shortfall path.
- **It bills the SHARE, never the total.** `short-sent` is reached only after a
  restate found nothing restatable and nothing already covering, so the settled
  share is provably absent from the invoice that went out. Every share is billed
  exactly once, and no figure is ever read back off a sent invoice.
- **It is anchored and idempotent like the first, through the SAME locked
  decision.** `enqueueXeroSecondSupplementaryInvoiceOperation` is a NAMED path
  over `enqueueXeroSupplementaryInvoiceOperation`, anchored to the
  `ManualRefundTask` whose share it bills: one invoice per share, safe to run
  twice, and invisible to every read that decides whether the booking change
  already has an invoice going out. It attaches to no PaymentIntent and is
  queued PENDING rather than WAITING_PAYMENT. Both endings are recorded:
  `INV-PAY-071`.

## INV-PAY-071

- **Both endings of a shortfall are recorded, with opposite instructions**
  (#3193). A raised second ask writes
  `booking.editFinancialReview.chargeShareReinvoiced` (`payment`, `info`,
  `success`), because a member about to receive two invoices for one change will
  ask why. `booking.editFinancialReview.chargeShareUncollected` fires only when
  the second invoice was NOT raised, and its prose says why: `failed` means raise
  one by hand for the difference only; `withheld` means the change's own invoice
  had not gone out yet, so check this booking against Xero before billing
  anything; `unavailable` means the difference cannot be worked out
  automatically, so do NOT raise one and run the booking-vs-Xero repair instead
  (the recovery replay is the one caller there — it holds the edit's combined
  total and no single share); `nothing-to-bill` means no positive difference.
- **The booking-vs-Xero repair tool reads the expected supplementary-invoice
  total from the settled review shares** rather than from the
  `BookingModification` row, which a parked edit leaves at zero (#3187) — so a
  missing invoice is queued for the settled total and one that went out short is
  reported as `XERO_AMOUNT_MISMATCH` for a person to correct. Since #3193 it is
  the instrument for the `withheld` case that #3193 deliberately does NOT bill:
  a share withheld while the change's invoice was in flight.

## INV-PAY-064

- **A durable retry closes the debt only when the ask EXISTS afterwards.** The
  recovery replay re-derives the total through the same sync the inline
  completion uses, which reports which of four things happened (`nothing-owed`,
  `raised`, `already-paid`, `not-raised`); on `not-raised` the replay leaves its
  operation open so the existing back-off, retry and admin-alert machinery
  carries the debt, because the mint SWALLOWS a provider failure by design and
  the re-enqueued row's upsert does not reset `status`.
- **A recovered ask raises the accounting invoice the inline attempt deferred**
  (#3181). The inline settlement SKIPS the supplementary invoice while an
  additional Stripe payment is required and no intent exists yet; the replay
  completes the deferral by re-entering the same settlement dispatcher with the
  intent set, on BOTH forks (an ordinary edit bills the `BookingModification`'s
  signed components, a review charge bills the combined total). It queues no
  second invoice because the anchor-scoped, advisory-locked decision is the only
  one. A failure to queue is recorded and NOT retried, because the replay has
  already written this edit's `ADDITIONAL` transaction and a retry would read
  that row as a supersession; that binds EVERY `await` after the write, and the
  read of the signed components happens BEFORE the mint. The booking-vs-Xero
  repair pass offers `QUEUE_SUPPLEMENTARY_INVOICE` built from the same two
  components.
- **The replay bills the EDIT's answer to "was there an invoice to supplement",
  never the answer that is true when the cron arrives** (#3181). A primary
  invoice minted after the edit already bills the edit itself, so the edit-time
  value is frozen on the recovery row
  (`PaymentRecoveryOperation.hadIssuedXeroInvoice`) and read back; NULL means
  "not recorded" and raises nothing, because a missing invoice is surfaced by the
  repair pass and a duplicate one by nobody. The repair pass's own answer, and
  the records a replay leaves, are `INV-PAY-072`.

## INV-PAY-072

- **The booking-vs-Xero repair pass asks the same question from the operation
  history** (#3199), for historical bookings with no `hadIssuedXeroInvoice`: the
  primary invoice counts as raised before an edit only when a SUCCEEDED or
  PARTIAL `INVOICE`/`CREATE` operation carrying that invoice's `xeroObjectId`
  has an EARLIEST `completedAt` strictly before `BookingModification.createdAt`;
  anything else is `unknown`, and reports at `manual_review` with no action rather than billing; `--apply` skips it and nothing is dropped silently. The check engages on an edit whose modification row nets positive OR that added a guest, never on the expected ask (`resolvePrimaryInvoiceEditTiming` in
  `xero-booking-repair-analysis.ts`, pinned by `xero-booking-repair.test.ts`).
- **A replay raises no invoice against an ask that was already paid** (#3181):
  its webhook cannot fire again, so a WAITING_PAYMENT invoice would never be
  released and would read as `BLOCKED_BY_XERO_OPERATION` instead of the critical
  one-click `MISSING_SUPPLEMENTARY_INVOICE`.
- **The review fork's failure to raise leaves its own durable record** (#3181):
  `booking.editFinancialReview.chargeShareUncollected` on the `xero-invoice` leg
  with cause `ask-not-raised`, distinct from `ask-closed` (an invoice exists and
  bills too little) and `ask-owed-unknown` (a recovery row predating
  `hadIssuedXeroInvoice`, which names the repair pass and says not to raise one
  by hand, because the primary invoice may already bill the charge).
- **Every path that settles a share without producing a request leaves a durable
  trace** — an audit row with a `leg` of `payment-request` or `xero-invoice`,
  never only a `logger.warn`. Since #3193 the `xero-invoice` leg reaches that row
  only when the second invoice could not be raised; when it was raised the trace
  is `chargeShareReinvoiced`, so "no row" never has to be read as "probably fine".

## INV-PAY-065

- **The card route is capped before it claims, and keyed to the TASK.** The cap
  is measured off the booking's captured `PaymentTransaction` rows, not off
  `Payment.source`. Both the cap and the frozen
  per-transaction allocation are answered before the claim, because
  `refundPaymentTransactions` refuses after the commit, where a refusal would
  leave a permanently COMPLETED task with nothing moved. The Stripe idempotency
  key prefix and the recovery operation are keyed to the TASK rather than the
  `BookingModification`: one edit can raise TWO review tasks, so a
  modification-scoped key would let two same-amount refunds share one Stripe key
  and let two tasks upsert one recovery row.
- **The refund debt is persisted inside the completion transaction, before any
  provider call**. This path holds no
  advisory lock, so its claim commits before Stripe is called; the cron replays
  the frozen slices under the stored task-scoped prefix, Stripe answers a repeat
  with the original refund, and the ledger dedupes on refund id.
- **`applyLocalRefundAllocation` compare-and-sets** on the `refundedAmountCents`
  it read (#3032), so two writers on one row cannot OVERSTATE the headroom; a
  review completion allocates against a LIVE booking with no lock. It retries
  against the fresh total (#3640) and refuses only when the headroom is gone;
  the completion turns that into a 409, rolled back, its task still OPEN.
- **The settlement anchor is the ORIGINAL edit's `BookingModification`** (owner
  decision D-3032-1), carried on `reviewContext.bookingModificationId` and
  deliberately NOT part of the occurrence identity. `MemberCredit.sourceBookingModificationId`
  is unique, so an anchor that already carries a credit is refused with a typed
  409 — ANY pre-existing credit, including one whose amount matches, because a
  matching amount is indistinguishable from a coincidence. The refusal tells the
  operator to settle the amount another way and dismiss with a note, an honest
  terminal state under the DISMISSED definition.

## INV-PAY-066

- **While a review is OPEN, a second money-affecting edit to that booking is
  refused** (#3032, `assertNoPendingEditFinancialReview`), because pricing one
  would mean starting from the amount under review. **All FOUR money-affecting
  doors are fenced**: the batch edit, the date edit, the single-guest removal,
  and `POST /api/bookings/[id]/guests`, which reprices inline in the route. Each is called inside the transaction, after the locks and the post-lock re-read, below authorisation and before any write, and each surfaces the 409 with its `code` above its handler's generic `ApiError` branch. Identity-only edits, credit elections, the price-preserving admin date
  shift and consent-authority removals (owner decision D-14) are not fenced.
- **Three database constraints, because prose is not enforcement** (migration
  `20260903010000`). An `EDIT_FINANCIAL_REVIEW` row must carry its
  `occurrenceKey` (`ManualRefundTask_edit_review_occurrence_key_present`) —
  PostgreSQL exempts NULL from a unique index. Every OTHER kind must carry an
  amount (`ManualRefundTask_non_edit_review_amount_present`). A non-null
  `raisedAmountCents` requires a non-null `amountCents`
  (`ManualRefundTask_raised_amount_requires_amount`). That `raisedAmountCents` is
  never amended is a property of an UPDATE and is NOT enforced by the database;
  it holds because the column has one writer and every completion audits the
  previous and raised figures.
- **An OPEN review can block reversal of a manual settlement**, accepted as
  correct (owner decision D-3032-2). It falls out of `INV-PAY-045`. MEASURED
  SCOPE: that guard reads `{ paymentId, status: OPEN }`, so it is scoped to the
  PAYMENT, not the booking — a review raised against a captured payment blocks a
  reversal of that payment's manual settlement; the ordinary credit-only review
  (`paymentId` NULL) blocks nothing.
- **What #3030 enforces versus what #3032 wires.** #3030 ships the state, the
  single occurrence-key mint, the raise, the DB constraints and the audited
  completion. #3032 adds the settlement routing, the anchor, the Xero leg, the
  pending-review fence — and ONE production raise caller:
  `removeBookingGuestInTransaction`, where an unpriceable single-guest removal
  commits structurally and parks its money (`INV-MOD-028`). The in-progress
  batch edit does NOT yet raise; it still refuses, for the structural reason
  stated in `INV-MOD-028`.

## INV-PAY-052

- **A replacement SetupIntent retires the previous card, and a retired card is
  never re-adopted from a stale SetupIntent** (#3266, epic #3270). A PENDING
  booking with non-member guests is charged later from the card its
  `Payment.stripePaymentMethodId` names, by the cron and by both admin charge
  routes, and none of them asks Stripe first. So the row's card column must
  mean "a card that may be charged", and these rules keep it meaning that:

- The rest of this rule, in order: minting and the succeeded-SetupIntent proxy
  `INV-PAY-073`; the card-stamp guard and the cancel path `INV-PAY-074`; the
  member-facing form and this rule's own test pins `INV-PAY-075`.

## INV-PAY-073

_Split from `INV-PAY-052` (#3266, epic #3270)._

- **Minting a replacement clears the card.** When `create-setup-intent` mints
  a new SetupIntent for a row that already has one, its upsert sets
  `stripePaymentMethodId` to NULL alongside the new intent id. Only
  `markBookingSetupIntentSucceeded` — the `setup_intent.succeeded` webhook, or
  the route's own re-adopt arm — puts a card back, and it puts back the card
  that intent saved. This is the same convention `booking-modify-settlement.ts`
  follows when it invalidates a card; the one deliberate exception
  (`booking-credit-election.ts` keeping a settled split parent's card for the
  child's deferred charge) is a settled row this route never reaches.

- **A succeeded SetupIntent is not, by itself, proof of a chargeable card, and
  the route and the webhook apply ONE rule.** `classifySucceededSetupIntentCard`
  (`setup-intent-card.ts`) is the single verdict that both
  `create-setup-intent`'s `alreadySaved` arm and the `setup_intent.succeeded`
  handler call, so the two cannot drift (`INV-SSOT-001`). Its only fast path
  is a row that ALREADY carries this intent's own card. A row carrying no card,
  or a different card, is answered by the PROVIDER (`setupIntentCardStillAttached`):
  the intent's payment method is adopted only if Stripe still reports it
  attached to the customer the row charges with. A row
  carrying a DIFFERENT card is not evidence about this one either: the intent's
  card may be exactly the one a charge path retired. Detached, attached to
  someone else, or `resource_missing` means the card is gone: the route mints
  a fresh SetupIntent under the chained idempotency key, and the webhook writes
  nothing. Any OTHER Stripe failure is not a verdict — the route fails (500)
  rather than guess, and the webhook rethrows so its processed-event claim is
  released and Stripe retries — because re-adopting risks charging a dead card
  and minting afresh would strip a live one.

## INV-PAY-074

_Split from `INV-PAY-052` (#3266, epic #3270)._

- **The card stamp is guarded on the row still naming the intent.** Stripe
  redelivers a failed `setup_intent.succeeded` for up to three days, and the
  processed-event dedupe knows only events already handled, so an event can
  arrive for the FIRST time after the member has re-saved onto a replacement
  intent. `handleSetupIntentSucceeded` reads the row first and does nothing
  when its `stripeSetupIntentId` is not this intent; `markBookingSetupIntentSucceeded`
  re-checks under the write — an `updateMany` keyed on `bookingId` AND
  `stripeSetupIntentId` — writes only the card column, and never writes the
  intent id: `create-setup-intent`'s upsert is the only writer of
  `stripeSetupIntentId`. A stamp that matches no row is a logged no-op
  (`stamped: false`). The route's re-adopt arm satisfies the guard by
  construction, because it stamps the intent's own card onto the row that
  named that intent.

- **`setup_intent.canceled` leaves the row alone.** The handler used to null
  `stripeSetupIntentId`. The next mint then fell back to
  `seti_<bookingId>_initial` — the ORIGINAL intent's idempotency key — which
  inside Stripe's 24-hour window replays the original creation, handing the
  member the canceled intent as if it were new. The row keeps the canceled id:
  the route reads the intent's live status, mints afresh when it is canceled,
  and chains the new key from that id. The card column is untouched too — a
  cancel says nothing about the card on file. A cancelled BOOKING clears its own
  intent id inside its locked claim (`booking-cancel.ts`), so nothing relied on
  the webhook to do it.

## INV-PAY-075

_Split from `INV-PAY-052` (#3266, epic #3270)._

- **The member can always get back to the form, and the form shows exactly
  when the cron would find nothing to charge.** The booking page's "Save
  Payment Method" card keys on `savedPaymentMethodForBooking` (`INV-PAY-053`:
  own row, then split parent's, each needing customer, card AND SetupIntent)
  returning `null` — one named const the admin button's will-charge wording
  also reads — not on "no SetupIntent yet" and not on the card column alone.
  So an abandoned replacement, a retired card, and a legacy split child
  carrying a copied card that was never saved through a SetupIntent all show
  the form again rather than a dead end, while a child whose parent holds a
  reusable card is not asked for one the cron will not need. Pinned by
  `saved-card-provenance-contract.test.ts`.

- Pinned by `payment-intent-routes.test.ts` (cases (a)-(g) and (b2)),
  `setup-intent-card.test.ts`, `payment-reconciliation.test.ts`
  (`markBookingSetupIntentSucceeded`), `stripe-webhook-alerts.test.ts`
  ("SetupIntent webhooks") and `saved-card-provenance-contract.test.ts`.

## INV-PAY-053

- **A saved card is charged off-session only with SetupIntent provenance, and
  that is decided in one place** (#3269, epic #3270). A `Payment` row that
  carries a `stripePaymentMethodId` is not, by itself, a card this application
  may charge again. Two writers stamp that column: `markBookingSetupIntentSucceeded`
  (the `setup_intent.succeeded` webhook and the setup-intent route's already-saved
  arm) writes the payment method together with `stripeSetupIntentId`, and a
  SetupIntent is the only path that attaches a card to the customer for reuse —
  nothing sets `setup_future_usage` on the Payment Element. `markBookingPaymentSucceeded`
  writes the payment method a one-off PaymentIntent used, which Stripe refuses to
  charge a second time. So the question "may this booking's saved card be charged
  off-session?" is answered by `savedPaymentMethodForBooking` in
  `src/lib/saved-payment-method.ts` and nowhere else: a row offers a card only
  when `stripeCustomerId`, `stripePaymentMethodId` AND `stripeSetupIntentId` are
  all set on that same row, the booking's own row is asked first and its split
  parent's (#738) second, and the answer says which row supplied the card. Every
  reader of that question — the settlement cron, the admin
  confirm-pending-guests route (which loads the parent's payment row so a child
  can still be confirmed on the parent's genuinely saved card), the member
  booking page (its "Save Payment Method" form and the admin button's "will
  charge" wording, from one const), `charge-saved-method` (own row only: it
  records the capture on the row it read and creates none) and the payment-link
  `not_payable` gate — imports it. A parent that paid its own place by one-off
  card checkout therefore leaves the child with NO card, and the child takes the
  same payment-link path as a child of an Internet-Banking parent
  (`INV-CAP-005`), instead of a charge that cannot succeed.

- The rest of this rule: the write-time guard `INV-PAY-076`; what the SetupIntent proxy does not prove `INV-PAY-077`.

## INV-PAY-076

_Split from `INV-PAY-053` (#3269, epic #3270)._

- **No charge CLAIM writes the card column.** The claim's upsert
  (`savedPaymentMethodRowStamp`, spread by the settlement cron and the admin
  confirm-pending-guests route) writes the `stripeCustomerId` the booking is
  charged under and nothing else, whichever row supplied the card. Not the
  parent's payment method: copying it is what turned a one-off checkout
  artefact into a "saved card" the admin button and both charge routes then
  trusted — in production the parent and child rows carried the identical
  payment method. And not the booking's own payment method either, even
  though writing it back looks like a no-op: the claim races the setup-intent
  route's replacement mint, which clears the payment method beside a fresh
  `stripeSetupIntentId`, and a write-back of the value the claim read would
  leave the old card next to the new id — a card mid-replacement that passes
  this very check. A claim that writes only the customer can resurrect nothing.

- **A captured charge records the card that paid, as on every paid row, and
  that copy never reads as reusable.** The claim is not the only writer. After
  a charge attempt, `upsertPaymentIntentTransaction` →
  `reconcilePaymentAggregates` mirrors the latest primary attempt's payment
  method onto the row whether it succeeded, failed or is still pending, and
  `markBookingPaymentSucceeded` writes the payment method that paid. So a PAID
  child charged on its parent's card carries that card, and a PENDING child
  whose borrowed charge failed or is pending carries it too — both without a
  `stripeSetupIntentId`, so `reusableSavedPaymentMethodOnRow` offers neither
  for a second charge. The predicate is what makes the copy harmless, not the
  absence of the copy. A legacy row of the laundered shape — customer and
  payment method, no `stripeSetupIntentId` — reads as "no card" for the same
  reason, which repairs it without a migration.

## INV-PAY-077

_Split from `INV-PAY-053` (#3269, epic #3270)._

- **What the proxy does not prove, stated so nobody widens it by accident.**
  On a legacy row, `stripeSetupIntentId` does not prove the payment method
  beside it is the SetupIntent's card: before `INV-PAY-054`'s derivation rule
  a later Payment Element capture on a row still carrying an old SetupIntent
  id overwrote the payment method with a one-off one, which passed this
  check. Since that rule the only writers of the card column are the guarded
  SetupIntent stamp, the ledger reconcile — which leaves a row carrying a
  SetupIntent alone — and the null-writers, so a row carrying a SetupIntent
  written after it shipped holds that intent's card or nothing and the proxy
  is exact for it; the hazard survives only in rows the old reconcile wrote,
  and #3268's terminal handling of a Stripe refusal is the backstop there.
  Nor does it prove the SetupIntent succeeded: the
  setup-intent route stamps a freshly minted id, and a row holding a stale
  payment method beside a replacement id is #3266's repair. The rule here is
  the gate, not the whole defence.

## INV-PAY-054

**Related: `INV-PAY-027`, `INV-PAY-030`, `INV-INT-001`, `INV-INT-003`.**

- **An unusable saved card is terminal for automation: retired at the provider,
  cleared from every row carrying it, escalated once** (#3268, epic #3270). When
  the confirm-pending cron's off-session charge THROWS, the error is classified
  before anything is retried (`src/lib/saved-card-charge-failure.ts`). Three
  shapes are terminal — Stripe rejecting the payment method itself
  (`invalid_request_error` naming the pm by `param`, by a `payment_method_*` /
  `resource_missing` code, or, as a commented last resort, by the documented
  incident wording); a `card_error` whose code or `decline_code` Stripe documents
  as "do not retry", including `authentication_required`, which no off-session
  retry can satisfy, and `advice_code: do_not_try_again`, Stripe's own
  do-not-retry signal; and a soft decline still declining once the charge is two
  days past due (the second ~2-day window from the moment it first became due).
  Everything else —
  a soft decline inside that window, an `api_error`, a rate limit, an
  idempotency error, a plain `Error` — keeps the pre-#3268 release-alert-retry
  behaviour, so the classifier can only narrow the retry loop, never widen it.

- The rest of this rule: the detach-and-clear mechanics `INV-PAY-078`; what the ledger derivation leaves alone `INV-PAY-079`; the single escalation `INV-PAY-080`.

## INV-PAY-078

_Split from `INV-PAY-054` (#3268, epic #3270); its lead bullet continues in
`INV-PAY-079`._

- **Terminal means the card leaves every row, not just this booking's.** The
  capacity claim is released first, exactly as before. Then the pm is detached
  at Stripe — a plain provider call outside any transaction (`INV-INT-003`)
  that GATES the clears: a detach Stripe refuses with `invalid_request_error`
  (already detached, never attached, no longer exists) is swallowed because the
  pm is unusable either way, but any other detach failure — an `api_error`, a
  rate limit, a connection error — is rethrown before a single row is written
  and the run falls back to the ordinary retry alert, so **a cleared card is
  always a detached card** and the setup-intent route can never find it still
  attached and re-adopt it. Then it is cleared from every
  `Payment.stripePaymentMethodId` equal to it — the child's row AND the parent
  row a split child borrowed it from, which is what stops the next run
  re-borrowing it — and nulled on every `PaymentTransaction.paymentMethodId`
  equal to it. The ledger clear is hygiene, not a charge-loop guard. Under
  the derivation rule below a split child's `Payment` row (no
  `stripeSetupIntentId` — its pm was borrowed, not saved) would have a stale
  PROCESSING or `legacy_primary_backfill` ledger row's retired pm copied back
  onto it by the next reconcile, but that copy is refused for charging by
  `reusableSavedPaymentMethodOnRow` (`INV-PAY-053`), and the parent row it
  borrowed from always carries a SetupIntent, so the derivation never touches
  the parent's card column and no later parent reconcile can restore the card
  for the child to re-borrow.

## INV-PAY-079

_Split from `INV-PAY-054` (#3268, epic #3270); continuing `INV-PAY-078`'s
"Terminal means the card leaves every row" bullet._

- The ledger rows are nulled anyway so that no row
  anywhere names a retired card — a `paymentMethodId` on a captured row is
  informational (the reconcile derivation is its only production reader;
  refunds and recovery key on the intent id, never on the pm). That costs
  provenance — a captured historical row no longer records which card paid —
  and is accepted.
  `stripeSetupIntentId` and `stripeCustomerId` are left in place: the
  setup-intent route's idempotency chain depends on the previous id staying
  put (#3266), and provider-side detachment is what makes "may not be
  re-adopted anywhere" true.

- **The ledger never moves a saved card.** `reconcilePaymentAggregates` derives
  `Payment.stripePaymentMethodId` from the latest PRIMARY ledger row only
  within this rule: when the latest PRIMARY is a Stripe row and the `Payment`
  carries a `stripeSetupIntentId`, the column is left exactly as it is — the
  SetupIntent writers (the setup-intent route, the `setup_intent.succeeded`
  webhook) and this retire path own it, and a ledger row says nothing about
  which card is CURRENTLY saved; when the `Payment` carries no SetupIntent the
  ledger row's pm is followed, but a Stripe row that recorded no pm (a
  pre-charge attempt row, a row this path nulled) never nulls a card that is
  set; a non-Stripe (Internet Banking) latest PRIMARY still yields null,
  because #1967 depends on the IB switch dropping the card. The failure this
  forbids: retire, then the member re-saves a new card, then a late
  `payment_intent.canceled` for the OLD intent reconciles while the old,
  nulled row is still the latest PRIMARY — and the new card is wiped. Pinned
  in `payment-transactions-refunds.test.ts` ("#3268").

## INV-PAY-080

_Split from `INV-PAY-054` (#3268, epic #3270)._

- **Escalated once, by construction rather than by counter.** One member email
  (`saved-card-charge-failed`, booking-scoped so the "No emails" switch applies)
  and one admin alert through the existing payment-failure template, its body
  saying in plain English that the card was found unusable, has been removed,
  that the member has been asked to save a new one, and quoting Stripe. After
  this run the pm is gone from every row, so the next run never reaches the
  charge arm for it: a split child takes the #1967 payment-link path with its
  capped cadence, a plain booking takes `missing_payment_method`, which only
  logs. A rerun of the SAME run — a crash between the clear and the notices —
  re-sends, the ordinary at-least-once shape every cron notice here accepts.
  The soft-decline window is a pure function of time from the claim's own hold
  deadline (clamped to creation), which `releaseChargeClaim` writes back
  unchanged, so a rerun in the same window reaches the same answer
  (`INV-INT-001`). Nothing in the PROCESSING / `requires_action` branch changes:
  an intent that RETURNED is not a thrown failure.

  never-double-charge guard lives on the ledger under the claim's locks**
  (#3267, epic #3270; owner decision, option b). Three paths charge a saved card
  off-session — the settlement cron, the admin confirm-pending-guests route and
  `charge-saved-method` — and until #3267 all three sent one Stripe idempotency
  key, `pending_charge_<bookingId>`, relying on it as the guard against two
  paths charging one booking twice. The contract now lives in two modules split at the
  provider call — `src/lib/saved-card-charge-attempt.ts` (what an attempt is,
  beginning one, asking Stripe) and `src/lib/saved-card-charge-settle.ts`
  (recording the answer) — and every path uses all of it:

- The remaining sub-rules of this attempt ledger: `INV-PAY-081` through `INV-PAY-090`.

- Pinned by `saved-card-charge-attempt.test.ts` (both modules, against a
  ledger that applies the status guards), `cron-confirm-pending.test.ts`
  ("#3267" and the "#3268" ordering pin),
  `admin-confirm-pending-guests-route.test.ts`,
  `charge-saved-method-route.test.ts` (the claim it gained),
  `payment-transactions-refunds.test.ts` (the intent pointer an attempt row
  must not null), `stripe-webhook-alerts.test.ts` (adoption by the event's
  idempotency key) and `advisory-lock-guard.test.ts` (the two new
  `charge-saved-method` sites).

## INV-PAY-081

_Split from `INV-PAY-055` (#3267, epic #3270)._

- **One attempt = one PRIMARY Stripe `PaymentTransaction`, created BEFORE
  Stripe is asked, whose own id is in the key.** `beginSavedCardChargeAttempt`
  runs INSIDE the caller's claim transaction — global `pg_advisory_xact_lock(1)`
  then the lodge capacity lock, after the status-guarded PENDING -> CONFIRMED
  claim — and creates the row (PENDING, the card about to be charged, the
  path's `reason`), then stamps its `reference` with
  `pending_charge_<bookingId>_<rowId>`. A row is an attempt row only when its
  `reference` is the key built from ITS OWN id. Because every path writes its
  row under the same two locks, two paths can never both hold an open attempt
  for one payment: the second to take the locks reads the first's row. That is
  the guard the shared key used to provide by accident, and it now covers
  `charge-saved-method`, which gained the same claim (it had none) so that its
  row is written under the same locks — a route writing its attempt unlocked
  would re-open the race the ledger closes.

- **Metadata converges on one builder.** `buildSavedCardChargeMetadata`
  returns `{ bookingId, memberId }` for every path; the per-path `source` that
  broke the shared key is gone, and which path minted an attempt is recorded on
  the row's `reason` (`SAVED_CARD_CHARGE_REASON`, a closed union). The one
  charge call is `chargeSavedCardAttempt`; nothing else calls
  `chargePaymentMethod` for a saved card.

## INV-PAY-082

_Split from `INV-PAY-055` (#3267, epic #3270); "definite failure" defined in
`INV-PAY-083`._

- **An unresolved attempt on the same card is REPLAYED, and a replay asks
  about THAT attempt.** A PENDING/PROCESSING attempt row whose
  `paymentMethodId` is the card about to be charged — or is null with no
  intent, the shape `INV-PAY-054`'s retire leaves on a row whose first POST
  never answered — is returned as the attempt instead of a new row. When it
  already names its intent the charge step RETRIEVES the intent
  (`getPaymentIntent`), because Stripe's idempotency layer replays the
  ORIGINAL response body for ever (a first answer of `requires_action` never
  changes, however the challenge ended) and after the 24-hour window a re-sent
  key EXECUTES A NEW CHARGE; the recorded key is re-sent only for a row whose
  first POST never answered at all, where the key is the one thing that
  identifies the attempt at Stripe, and Stripe then answers with the stored
  result or executes exactly once. Either way exactly one instrument exists
  per attempt.

- **The Payment's intent pointer is not nulled by an attempt row.** An attempt
  row is a Stripe PRIMARY row born with NO intent id, and it stays so after a
  definite failure. `reconcilePaymentAggregates` derives
  `Payment.stripePaymentIntentId` from the latest PRIMARY row, so while an
  attempt row is the latest, any reconcile (the #1992 sweep's
  `payment_intent.canceled` webhook, a failed webhook) would null the pointer;
  `/pay` and `create-payment-intent` read that pointer to decide whether to
  mint, and a nulled pointer sends them back to the `_initial` key, which
  Stripe answers with the CANCELLED first intent — a dead client secret. So a
  Stripe latest PRIMARY without an intent keeps the pointer the Payment already
  holds, the same rule `INV-PAY-054` applies to the card column. A non-Stripe
  (Internet Banking) latest PRIMARY still yields null, unchanged.

## INV-PAY-083

_Split from `INV-PAY-055` (#3267, epic #3270)._

- **A definite failure ENDS the attempt; an ambiguous one keeps it.** A thrown
  failure is partitioned by the API error type read through
  `readStripeErrorFields` (`INV-SSOT-001` — the same reader `INV-PAY-054`'s
  classifier uses; the two partitions differ on purpose, an `idempotency_error`
  being definite here and `retry` there). `card_error`,
  `invalid_request_error`, `idempotency_error` and `authentication_error` mean
  Stripe answered and no charge is pending: the row is marked FAILED
  (status-guarded, PENDING/PROCESSING -> FAILED) BEFORE the original error is
  rethrown, so the next attempt mints a fresh key — the admin button works
  the moment the cron has failed, not a day later. `api_error`,
  `rate_limit_error`, a connection error and any non-Stripe error leave it
  uncertain whether the charge happened: the row stays PENDING and the next
  attempt replays it, so Stripe resolves whether the first call executed. That
  partition is for the POST. A replay that RETRIEVES its intent is a GET, where
  only `resource_missing` says anything about the attempt (the intent is gone,
  so the attempt is over): an `authentication_error` or an
  `invalid_request_error` on a read says nothing about an intent that may be
  `processing` right now, so every other read failure is ambiguous and the row
  is left for the next attempt to ask again. The
  Payment aggregate is not re-derived on a definite failure — before #3267 a
  thrown charge left no row and the Payment stayed at the claim's PENDING,
  which is what a pending booking whose charge failed should read as.

## INV-PAY-084

_Split from `INV-PAY-055` (#3267, epic #3270)._

- **A charge minted under the old shared key is recognised by its reason and
  taken over, so nothing charges beside a live legacy intent.** This is the
  deploy cutover, and it is the one place a row that is NOT an attempt row is
  ended. A PENDING/PROCESSING PRIMARY Stripe row with no `reference`, naming an
  intent and carrying one of the `SAVED_CARD_CHARGE_REASON` values, was minted
  by a saved-card charge path before #3267 under the shared key
  `pending_charge_<bookingId>`; on the card about to be charged it is replayed
  by retrieve like any other in-flight row, and **on any other card it is
  ended and its intent cancelled or waited on**, exactly as a superseded
  attempt row is. Before #3267 the shared key itself stopped a second charge
  beside such a row and the cron's #1992 sweep excluded it by those same two
  `reason` literals; the sweep now excludes attempt rows by the key prefix,
  which a reference-less row does not carry, so without this the first
  post-deploy run would sweep a legacy `processing` intent with the cancel-only
  call, find it uncancellable, log "likely already succeeded" and charge the
  new card beside live money — with only `INV-PAY-043` between that and the
  member on the cron, and nothing at all on the two routes, which run no sweep.
  Recognising the row in the claim fixes all three paths at once and needs no
  new lock. It requires an intent id, so a legacy row can never be replayed by
  re-sending a key nothing ever sent; every pre-#3267 PRIMARY Stripe row was
  written from a Stripe answer, so that shape does not arise. The rule
  self-expires: nothing mints a reference-less saved-card row any more.

## INV-PAY-085

_Split from `INV-PAY-055` (#3267, epic #3270)._

- **An unresolved attempt on a card that has since been replaced is ended and
  its intent cancelled.** A PENDING/PROCESSING attempt row on a DIFFERENT card
  (`INV-PAY-052`'s replacement, `INV-PAY-054`'s retirement), or whose card was
  nulled while its intent still exists, is marked FAILED with its `reason`
  suffixed `:superseded_by_new_card` inside the claim, and its intent is
  cancelled best-effort by `chargeSavedCardAttempt` AFTER commit and BEFORE the
  charge — a plain provider call, never inside the transaction
  (`INV-INT-003`). Marking FAILED before Stripe confirms the cancel is
  deliberate and repaired three times over if wrong. A superseded intent the
  cancel finds already `succeeded` IS the capture — it is returned as the
  answer, nothing is charged, and `settleSavedCardChargeAttempt` moves that row
  to SUCCEEDED and removes the fresh attempt row. One it finds still
  `processing` is LIVE and may capture any second — Stripe refuses to cancel a
  card payment in that state, and that refusal must never read as "not
  cancellable, nothing to do", which was a second charge with only #1992
  between it and the member — so its row is put BACK to PROCESSING and the
  intent is returned as the answer: this run waits on it, and the next run ends
  and asks about it again until it captures or dies. Every stale intent is
  visited before an answer is returned, so one that CAN be cancelled still is;
  a capture outranks a live intent when both are found. And a
  `payment_intent.succeeded`
  webhook for it moves the row to SUCCEEDED too. A superseded intent that
  captures after this attempt has also captured is the second capture the
  #1992 duplicate-capture auto-refund hands back (`INV-PAY-043`).

## INV-PAY-086

_Split from `INV-PAY-055` (#3267, epic #3270)._

- **Captured money refuses a new attempt.** A PRIMARY Stripe row still holding
  net captured cash (`isCapturedTransactionStatus`, minus a fully refunded row) on a still-PENDING booking THROWS
  `SavedCardChargeRefusedError` from inside the claim, so the whole claim rolls
  back — nothing claimed, nothing charged — and the caller logs at error level
  on every attempt until a person, or a redelivered webhook that finds the row
  by intent id, settles it.
  Every PRIMARY Stripe row
  counts here, attempt row or not; the rows that are neither attempt rows nor
  legacy shared-key rows (an in-flight /pay link intent on another card, or on
  no card yet) are otherwise left to the mechanisms that own them.

- **Ordering with `INV-PAY-054`, load-bearing and invisible from either side
  alone.** The retire path nulls `PaymentTransaction.paymentMethodId` on every
  row carrying the retired card, attempt rows included. That is safe ONLY
  because a definite failure marks the attempt FAILED before the rethrow
  reaches the cron's terminal branch: were the row still PENDING with its card
  nulled, the next attempt would read "unresolved, no card, no intent" and
  replay a key whose stored body names the retired card — an
  `idempotency_error` on the new card, one wasted run. The one shape that can
  still reach that replay — two split children borrowing one parent card, one
  failing ambiguously and the other terminally — resolves itself within a run
  (Stripe executes the replay once, or answers `idempotency_error`, which is
  definite), and is a duplicate only if the first POST also captured under a
  lost webhook, where `INV-PAY-043` is the backstop.

## INV-PAY-087

_Split from `INV-PAY-055` (#3267, epic #3270); continuing `INV-PAY-086`'s
refusal bullet — "the admin ALERT" and "the refusal" are defined there._

- The admin ALERT is capped: the cron sends it on the
  #1993 extension cadence (windows 1, 2, 3, then every 7th, once each), rather
  than eight times a day for ever; the two routes alert once per request, which
  is normally an admin's own click — `charge-saved-method` also accepts an
  `x-cron-secret` caller, so "per request" rather than "per person" is the
  honest description of the cap there. The cron's cadence is anchored on when
  the refusal became OBSERVABLE to the cron — the later of the witnessing
  ledger row's timestamp and the booking's charge due date — not on when the
  refused state began. The charge arm does not reach a booking until its hold
  expires, so a capture recorded days earlier would otherwise have its first
  observation land mid-window and skip that window's only alert: the traced
  case was a capture at T, a hold expiring at T+5 days, and no alert at all
  until T+12 days. The row's own timestamp also moves for reasons unrelated to
  the refusal (`INV-PAY-054`'s retire nulls the card by pm id across rows),
  which would restart the cadence at window 1.

- **A consequence of `INV-PAY-053` to expect, not to fix.** The attempt row
  carries the borrowed card on a split child's payment, and no claim writes the
  card column; but a reconcile of that PENDING child — a `Payment` row with no
  `stripeSetupIntentId` — mirrors the latest PRIMARY row's card onto it. The
  copy is expected and harmless because `reusableSavedPaymentMethodOnRow`
  refuses a card on a row without a SetupIntent; the predicate is what makes
  the copy harmless, not the absence of the copy.

## INV-PAY-088

_Split from `INV-PAY-055` (#3267, epic #3270)._

- **Stripe's answer is recorded on the attempt row, forward only.**
  `settleSavedCardChargeAttempt` stamps the intent id, the mapped status
  (`succeeded` -> SUCCEEDED; `canceled` and `requires_payment_method` -> FAILED,
  so a dead intent is not asked about for ever; every other status ->
  PROCESSING for the webhook or the next attempt to resolve), the amount and
  the card, then `reconcilePaymentAggregates`. If a row already exists for the
  intent, the attempt row is deleted and the existing row kept, its status
  moved FORWARD only — a captured answer over anything but refund history, a
  non-captured answer over an unresolved row only — and the `P2002` race on the
  unique intent id takes the same branch. No webhook creates such a row today;
  the branch is defensive and stated. Forward-only applies to the attempt's OWN
  row as much as to a kept one, and it is what makes the release safe: the
  retrieve says `processing`, the `succeeded` webhook lands and settles the
  booking PAID before the release takes its locks, and an unguarded write would
  put PROCESSING over SUCCEEDED, `reconcilePaymentAggregates` would derive
  `Payment.status = PROCESSING`, and the release's status-guarded
  CONFIRMED -> PENDING would match nothing and throw nothing — a PAID booking
  whose ledger shows no captured money. When the guard refuses the write the
  row's current status is read back and returned instead, nothing is
  reconciled, and the caller branches on that LEDGER status rather than on the
  intent's. All three paths then record inside their locked release
  transaction and, still under those locks, re-read the booking: one no longer
  CONFIRMED is not released at all — the webhook has settled it, and saying so
  in the log beats releasing into the dark.

## INV-PAY-089

_Split from `INV-PAY-055` (#3267, epic #3270)._

- **A key may only be RE-SENT inside Stripe's window, and a lost response is
  recovered by that key.** Stripe keeps an idempotency key for 24 hours; the
  same key sent after that is a new request and executes a NEW charge, with
  nothing local able to tell it apart from the first. So an attempt row that is
  PENDING with no intent and older than
  `SAVED_CARD_CHARGE_KEY_RESEND_WINDOW_MS` (23 hours, an hour of margin,
  measured from a `createdAt` stamped before the POST so the margin errs
  towards refusing) is NOT re-sent: `beginSavedCardChargeAttempt` throws
  `SavedCardChargeRefusedError` (`attempt_key_expired`) and a person checks
  Stripe. That state is rare because the normal recovery is quicker: a
  `payment_intent.succeeded` or `.payment_failed` webhook for an intent the
  ledger does not know adopts the PENDING no-intent attempt row whose
  `reference` equals the event's `request.idempotency_key` — the key is the one
  thing both sides hold — and settles it, forward only, before the handler
  proceeds as usual (`adoptSavedCardChargeAttemptForIntent`). Without that
  adoption a captured charge whose response was lost was invisible even to
  `INV-PAY-043`, and the re-send after 24 hours was a second charge. **Adoption
  is not a universal recovery, and the limit is Stripe's:** `Event.request` is
  null for any state change Stripe did not attribute to an API request, so an
  intent whose lost-response POST answered `processing` and captured
  asynchronously later produces a `payment_intent.succeeded` with no
  idempotency key at all. Nothing can adopt it; the row stays PENDING with no
  intent id and falls through to the 23-hour `attempt_key_expired` refusal,
  which is the fail-safe end of that road — no second charge, and a person is
  told to look in Stripe.

## INV-PAY-090

_Split from `INV-PAY-055` (#3267, epic #3270)._

- **The #1992 pre-charge sweep excludes attempt rows by the key prefix, and
  the sweep and the mint share the constant** (`SAVED_CARD_CHARGE_KEY_PREFIX`,
  `INV-SSOT-002`). A still-unresolved attempt row on this card is this run's
  attempt, so cancelling its intent would cancel this run's own charge. The
  exclusion used to match two `reason` literals, which never covered the admin
  route's rows at all. The sweep also excludes, BY ID, the row this run's claim
  chose to replay, because a row that is NOT an attempt row can still be this
  run's attempt: an unresolved PRIMARY Stripe row that names an intent and
  carries the very card about to be charged — a legacy row minted under the
  shared key before #3267 (reason set, no `reference`), or a /pay link intent
  the member is paying with that same saved card — is this booking's money in
  flight on this card, so the claim replays it by retrieve rather than charging
  beside it. Without that, at the deploy a legacy `processing` intent would be
  swept, found uncancellable, and charged beside — the very double charge this
  invariant exists to prevent. A legacy row on ANOTHER card needs no exclusion
  clause of its own: the claim has already ended it, so it is FAILED before the
  sweep's query runs and the status filter drops it, and its intent belongs to
  `chargeSavedCardAttempt`, which retrieves rather than cancels blind.

## INV-PAY-056

- **A payment recovery becomes terminally failed in exactly one place, and that
  place owns what a dead recovery costs** (#3220). A
  `PaymentRecoveryOperation` reaching `FAILED` with no attempts left is not a
  local bookkeeping detail: it is the moment the rest of the system is told to
  stop waiting for that debt. The booking-vs-Xero repair tool stops deferring
  and raises the edit's supplementary invoice UNPAID once the row is no longer
  `PENDING` or `PROCESSING` (`OPEN_PAYMENT_RECOVERY_STATUSES` in
  `xero-booking-repair-load.ts`, the control #3202 pins). So anything that must
  happen when a recovery dies has to happen on every route to that status —
  and there were three, each with its own status write, its own `nextRetryAt`
  policy and only one of the three alerting anybody.
  `markPaymentRecoveryOperationFailed` in `payment-recovery.ts` is now the only
  one, and `payment-recovery-terminal-failure-census.test.ts` fails when a
  second appears anywhere under `src/` or when the single write leaves that
  function. **The census counts the raw spelling too**, because Prisma types
  this enum as a string-literal union and `status: "FAILED"` is how nearly every
  other status writer in the tree is written: a `"FAILED"` literal in the
  arguments of any `paymentRecoveryOperation` write, or anywhere in
  `payment-recovery.ts`, fails it. Raw-string READS stay legal — three modules
  outside this one filter on the status and have to.

- The rest of this rule: terminality and the fenced write `INV-PAY-091`; what FAILED means to two different readers `INV-PAY-092`.

## INV-PAY-091

_Split from `INV-PAY-056` (#3220)._

- **Terminality is an argument, not a re-derivation**: the worker
  knows it has just burnt an attempt and the stale-worker reaper knows the row
  never came back, and a shared re-derivation from `attempts` would be a third
  opinion on a fact its callers already hold. `nextRetryAt` is forced to `null`
  when terminal rather than trusted from the caller, because a terminal row
  that keeps a retry time is re-claimable and is therefore not terminal.
  **The write is status-fenced**, like `completePaymentRecoveryOperation` and
  for the same reason: the worker's arm used `update` by id, which throws
  `P2025` on a row a manual mark-paid reversal deleted mid-flight — from inside
  the worker loop's own `catch`, so the throw escaped the loop and abandoned
  every remaining operation in the batch. A fenced `updateMany` matches
  nothing instead, and the fence also stops a `SUCCEEDED` row being dragged
  back to `FAILED` by a worker holding a stale in-memory copy. **A row that
  matched nothing is still tallied as this attempt's outcome**, so a row that
  turns out to have succeeded is counted in `failed` — a count of what the pass
  attempted, which nothing downstream branches on, rather than a claim about the
  row.

- **The stale-worker sweep is bounded and oldest-first.** It runs in front of
  the main queue, and centralising the transition means each row it takes now
  costs an alert and can cost a Stripe read and cancel, where the bulk
  `updateMany` it replaced made no provider call at all. A backlog drains on its
  own — every row the sweep touches leaves `PROCESSING` for good — so the cap
  only defers work to the next run, and reading oldest-first is what stops it
  deferring the same rows for ever.

## INV-PAY-092

_Split from `INV-PAY-056` (#3220)._

- **`FAILED` is two readings of one column, and the reader has to say which.** A
  `FAILED` row with attempts left is a retry waiting its turn; a `FAILED` row
  with none is dead. What separates them is the `attempts < MAX` filter beside
  the query, never the status alone — so that filter belongs to each query and
  the status sets themselves are named once
  (`CLAIMABLE_PAYMENT_RECOVERY_STATUSES`,
  `NON_TERMINAL_PAYMENT_RECOVERY_STATUSES`) rather than spelled inline at each
  reader. **That distinction is `payment-recovery.ts`'s own, and no other
  module's.** `OPEN_PAYMENT_RECOVERY_STATUSES` carries no `attempts` filter, so
  the repair tool stops deferring at the first failure rather than at death.
  Anyone reading the two-readings rule into that query will predict a deferral
  that is not there; `INV-PAY-057` states what follows from the gap.

## INV-PAY-057

- **A dead additional-payment recovery withdraws the ask it left standing**
  (#3220). A `CREATE_ADDITIONAL_PAYMENT_INTENT` recovery exists because a
  booking edit raised money the member has not been asked for yet. While it is
  `PENDING` or `PROCESSING` the booking-vs-Xero repair tool DEFERS the edit's
  supplementary invoice; once it leaves those statuses that deferral stops and
  the repair raises the invoice
  **unpaid** (`INV-PAY-056`, and the control #3202 pins). So a live
  PaymentIntent still standing at that transition is a **second instrument for
  one debt** — pay it and the club holds a payment and an unpaid invoice for the
  same money, which #3187 accepted as *visible but not fixed*. The terminal
  transition now cancels it, in `cancelStrandedAdditionalIntentForDeadRecovery`.

- The rest of this rule, in order: timing and what the withdrawal is not `INV-PAY-093`; when a duplicate genuinely exists `INV-PAY-094`; the cancel's safety and its stated reason `INV-PAY-095`.

## INV-PAY-093

_Split from `INV-PAY-057` (#3220)._

- **The withdrawal fires at the LAST failure; the deferral stops at the FIRST.**
  A retrying `FAILED` row is already outside `OPEN_PAYMENT_RECOVERY_STATUSES`, so
  it can meet an unpaid invoice while its ask is still live — the same
  two-instrument shape, but transient and self-healing: the retry either raises
  ask and invoice together or runs out and reaches this withdrawal. Cancelling on
  a non-terminal failure would be wrong, because the replay still intends to
  collect against that very ask. **This is a stated limit, not an oversight** —
  closing it means widening the repair tool's deferral to non-terminal `FAILED`
  rows, which is a change to #3202's counterpart and needs its own decision.

- **This removes the duplicate instrument. It does not write off the debt.** The
  unpaid invoice still stands and is collected the ordinary way; what goes away
  is the second way to pay it. Nobody may read the cancel as a forgiveness.

## INV-PAY-094

_Split from `INV-PAY-057` (#3220)._

- **It withdraws the ask only when there IS a duplicate, and one shape means
  there is not.** The replay attaches this change's supplementary invoice
  operation to the intent it mints, parked `WAITING_PAYMENT`, and can then throw
  while raising the deferred invoice — so a dead recovery can arrive here with a
  live ask AND a live outbox row pointing at it. That row is released by a
  confirmed payment on that intent and by nothing else, and while it stands the
  repair pass reports `BLOCKED_BY_XERO_OPERATION` and raises **no** invoice. So
  there is no second instrument to remove, and cancelling would take away the
  only live route to the money while stranding the row until the fourteen-day
  reaper retires it — the same harm the review-charge replay refuses to create on
  its already-paid branch, read from the other end. The withdrawal therefore
  checks for a `WAITING_PAYMENT` supplementary operation **on that exact intent**
  first and leaves the ask alone when it finds one, logging why. **What is left
  standing in that case is stated, not guaranteed away**: the member may still
  pay the ask, which is the clean ending; if they never do, the fourteen-day
  reaper retires the outbox row and the repair pass then raises the invoice the
  ordinary way.

- **Idempotent by construction, not by care.**
  `cancelPaymentIntentIfCancellableWithResult` reads the intent before it acts
  and makes **no provider call at all** unless the status is one it can cancel,
  so a replay finds `canceled` and does nothing, and an intent the member paid
  in the meantime is left strictly alone. The ledger's own captured-status check
  is a second lock on that same door rather than the only one.

## INV-PAY-095

_Split from `INV-PAY-057` (#3220)._

- **A refusal leaves the recovery exactly as not trying would.** The cancel runs
  **after** the status write and **never throws**: a provider outage must not be
  able to hold a recovery out of `FAILED`, which would re-block the repair tool
  for ever and break the #3202 control, and a throw from inside the worker
  loop's own `catch` abandons every remaining operation in the batch. Stripe
  routinely refuses to cancel a `processing` intent, so the refusal branch is
  live rather than theoretical; it is written to the **audit log**, because it
  asks an officer to reconcile by hand and a `logger.error` is not a record
  anybody can find.

- **The cancellation reason states the real cause.**
  `cancelPaymentIntentIfCancellableWithResult` takes it as a parameter rather
  than having gained a twin, and this path passes `abandoned`. The member never
  declined the ask; the club ran out of attempts to raise it, and
  `requested_by_customer` in the club's own Stripe record would misstate a money
  decision.

## INV-PAY-111

**Related: `INV-PAY-101`** (the settlement decision) **and `INV-INT-025`**
(resolved in Xero).

- **The operation that raised a refund credit note never completes SUCCEEDED
  without its settling payment or `refundPaymentSkipped`** (orchestrator
  decision on [#3548](https://github.com/thatskiff33/AlpineClubBookingsNZ/issues/3548)).
  The moment Xero returns the note, one transaction records its id on the
  payment, its covering link (amount, watermark, capture) and its id on the
  row. A process that dies after that leaves a FAILED row naming its note:
  coverage counts the note, so nothing re-mints it, and the retry finishes it.
- **One read-back-then-settle** (`finishRefundCreditNoteSettlement`) serves the
  builder's own row, the retry and repair leg, and the repair tool. It reads the
  note back and records what Xero shows (paid, allocated, or part-paid with
  `refundPaymentRemainingCents`) without a second payment. It skips a note
  whose own operation was resolved by hand; an unreadable resolved row refuses.
  Otherwise it pays under the one note-keyed key, dated the note's day. A failed
  payment re-reads the note, else completes PARTIAL.
- **What this does not cover, and why.** A replay that a recorded note already
  covers raised nothing, so it closes SUCCEEDED marked `coveredByExistingNote`,
  naming the note whose own row carries the outcome. Any failure between Xero
  committing the note and that transaction (a crash, a lost or timed-out
  response, a failed save) leaves nothing naming it, so only Xero's key replay
  (24 hours, `INV-INT-014`) stops a second one. Rows written before #3548
  are listed by the reconciliation report and the repair tool
  (`REFUND_CREDIT_NOTE_UNSETTLED`) and settled only by an operator.
