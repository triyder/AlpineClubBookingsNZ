# Security Attack Surface Inventory

This inventory was generated from the current repository state on 2026-05-28,
refreshed on 2026-06-21 during the issue #812 route-boundary review follow-up,
refreshed again on 2026-07-04 during the issue #1135 quality-wave security
review, and extended on 2026-07-05 with the multi-lodge route families
(`admin/lodges/**`, `/api/lodges`, `admin/members/[id]/lodge-access`, and the
bulk room/bed and locker seed endpoints) added on
`feature/multi-lodge-support`. The API count is from:

```bash
rg --files 'src/app/api' -g 'route.ts' | wc -l
```

Current count: 322 `src/app/api/**/route.ts` files.

The issue text for #612 mentioned 216 files. That count is stale; the route tree
has grown since (booking review, group-booking, Internet Banking, and Xero
operational routes). This document treats the route tree as the source of truth.

**Status of the original hardening programme:** issues #612–#619 are all
CLOSED. The living sections of this document (Boundary Summary, Route And
Surface Inventory, Route Family Coverage) were updated on 2026-07-04 to match
the current state: every admin API method reaches the shared `requireAdmin()`
guard and every finance method calls its documented viewer/manager guard,
enforced per exported HTTP method by the suites listed under Route Family
Coverage (issue #1132), and all three webhook handlers carry full
Critical-matrix route tests (issue #1133). Where a dated historical review
section below still says "#61x should…", treat it as a record of the review
that produced those issues, not as open work.

## Boundary Summary

Authentication and authorization currently use these mechanisms:

| Mechanism | Current implementation | Main route families |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auth.js session | `src/lib/auth.ts` exposes `auth()` backed by credentials login, JWT sessions, dynamic access-role refresh, email verification, and session invalidation on password change. | Member, admin, finance, lodge, booking, payment, profile routes. |
| Active-account guard | `requireActiveSessionUser()` in `src/lib/session-guards.ts` checks `Member.active` and `forcePasswordChange`. | Most session-authenticated routes. |
| Shared admin guard | `requireAdmin()` in `src/lib/session-guards.ts` combines Auth.js session, scoped access-role bundles (`getAdminRouteRequirement` area/level resolution), and active-account checks. | Every `/api/admin/**` route — each exported method must reach `requireAdmin()` (directly, via a local helper, or via an allowlisted shared wrapper), enforced per-method by `api-route-boundaries.test.ts` (#1132). The former hand-rolled inline admin checks (#613) are fully migrated. |
| Finance API guard | `requireFinanceViewerApiAccess()` and `requireFinanceManagerApiAccess()` in `src/lib/finance-api-auth.ts`. | `/api/finance/**`. |
| Lodge/kiosk guard | `checkLodgeAuth()` in `src/lib/lodge-auth.ts`, including active session and hut-leader PIN session support. | `/api/lodge/**` and lodge roster/guest routes. |
| Cron/deploy secret | Repeated `x-cron-secret` comparison against `CRON_SECRET`, usually with `timingSafeEqual`. | `/api/cron/**`, `/api/deploy/runtime-status`. |
| Provider signature | Stripe signed body, Xero HMAC, SES/SNS signature verification. | `/api/webhooks/**`. |
| Public exception | Explicit route metadata in `src/lib/api-route-security.ts`, backed by static route-boundary tests. | Anonymous health, contact, application, auth token, address autocomplete, committee, age-tier, and public token routes. |

Resolved (was a known guard gap): `src/app/api/admin/runtime-status/route.ts`
now uses the shared `requireAdmin()` guard, and `src/app/api/deploy/runtime-status/route.ts`
now uses the shared `requireCronSecret()` helper. Issue #613 (guard
standardisation and the explicit public-route allowlist) is closed.

### Rate limiting degraded mode (issue #1142)

Rate-limit counters are shared through Postgres (`RateLimitCounter`). When
that store is unreachable, `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` falls back to per-process
in-memory counters rather than failing requests. Limiters marked
`authSensitive` (login, register, membership application, forgot/reset
password, lodge PIN login, two-factor verify, contact form) fall back at a
reduced budget — `limit / DEGRADED_AUTH_LIMIT_DIVISOR` (currently 4, floored
at 1) — so degrading the store cannot be used to multiply a brute-force or
form-abuse budget across replicas or process restarts. Fail-closed was
rejected because a limiter-store-local fault (table lock, migration drift)
must not become a full login outage while ordinary auth queries still work.
The policy is frozen by tests in `src/lib/__tests__/rate-limit.test.ts`,
including the exact set of limiters marked auth-sensitive.

## Route And Surface Inventory

`External calls` means direct provider/network interaction or provider-backed
side effects from the route or the service it invokes. Database access is listed
under `Data touched` instead.

The `Residual risk or follow-up` column predates the closure of hardening
issues #612–#619; `#61x should…` phrasing there records which review covered
the row, not open work. Open findings now live in labelled GitHub issues
(`quality-wave` for the 2026-07 wave).

| Route or surface | Auth mechanism | Actor | Data touched | External calls | Rate, signature, or boundary controls | Logging and audit | Residual risk or follow-up |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src/proxy.ts` global proxy and module gates | No session auth. Applies CSP/security headers to page requests and selected API matcher paths; returns 404 for disabled module routes. | Anonymous and authenticated browser traffic. | Module settings via `loadEffectiveModuleFlags()`. | None. | CSP nonce, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, module route blocking. | No per-request audit. | API matcher is selective, not global for every API path. Keep route-level auth as the enforcement boundary. |
| `/api/health`, `/api/health/ready` | Public. | Load balancers, operators, anonymous callers. | DB reachability, runtime version/uptime, config readiness. Public responses omit provider error detail. | DB query only. | No rate limit. No secrets in response. | Logger debug/error only. | Anonymous callers can observe availability. #615 can decide whether to add light rate limiting or cache headers. |
| `/api/age-tier-settings`, `/api/committee` | Public read endpoints. | Anonymous website users. | Public age-tier/rate settings and published committee assignment presentation fields. | None. | No rate limit. Committee query selects active, published assignment fields only; member email is not selected or returned, phone is returned only when show-phone is enabled, and contact keys are returned only for contactable assignments. | None beyond DB errors if thrown. | Public committee names and optional phone numbers are intentional once an admin publishes the assignment; email remains server-only. |
| `/api/address-autocomplete/search`, `/api/address-autocomplete/details/[id]` | Public server-side proxy to Addy, gated by the `addressAutocomplete` Admin Module. | Anonymous website users. | Search terms, address suggestion ids, Addy result payloads. | Addy API via `src/lib/addy-api.ts`. | Module-route/proxy gate returns 404 while disabled, Zod query validation, `rateLimiters.addressAutocomplete` at 90/min/IP. Secrets stay server-side. | Minimal error responses, no audit. | Upstream-cost and enumeration surface remains public only when the module is enabled; manual address entry remains the fallback. |
| `/api/contact` | Public contact form. | Anonymous website users. | Name, email, message, optional published committee assignment recipient key. | SMTP/SES through `sendEmail()`. | Zod validation, CRLF checks, HTML escaping, `rateLimiters.contact` at 10/hour/IP. Committee recipient keys resolve server-side only when the assignment is active, published, contactable, and linked to an active member; delivery prefers the role email and falls back to linked member email server-side. | Email delivery logs through email layer; committee-routed messages store an opaque committee-contact marker instead of the private member recipient address; no audit log. | Spam and mailbox flooding are bounded but not CAPTCHA-backed. Invalid or non-contactable recipient keys safely fall back to the configured club contact address. |
| `/api/applications` | Public membership application submission. | Anonymous applicant. | Applicant PII, DOB, family member PII, nominator emails, application rows. | Email notifications through nomination/application service. | Zod validation, max family member count of 10, `rateLimiters.membershipApplication` at 3/hour/IP. | Logger on unexpected errors; application workflow records status in DB. | Public PII collection endpoint. #615 should review enumeration, attachment absence, response detail, and email storm controls. |
| `/api/auth/register` | Public but disabled. | Anonymous caller. | None. | None. | Always returns `410 Gone`; self-service registration replaced by applications. | None. | Low risk. Keep in explicit public allowlist so a future implementation cannot appear silently. |
| `/api/auth/[...nextauth]` | Public Auth.js credentials entrypoint. | Anonymous login attempts. | Member email, bcrypt password hash verification, session JWT, last login timestamp. | None. | `rateLimiters.login`, email verification gate, active-member gate, session invalidation after password changes, lodge extended session age. | Logger warns if last-login update fails. | Brute force is rate-limited in memory only. #615/#616 should revisit if deployment becomes multi-instance. |
| `/api/auth/forgot-password`, `/api/auth/reset-password`, `/api/auth/verify-email`, `/api/auth/resend-verification`, `/api/auth/confirm-email-change` | Public token and account recovery routes. | Anonymous user with email or token link. | Password reset/action tokens, verification tokens, member email status, email-change records, password hashes. | Email send; Xero contact update may run after email-change confirmation. | Per-route rate limiters for forgot/reset/resend/verification token; token helpers hash/store tokens and enforce expiry. | Audit logs for password reset and email-change flows where implemented; logger for failures. | Token-bearing URLs and account enumeration behavior need periodic review. #615 covers validation, non-enumerating responses, and token/log redaction. |
| `/api/auth/change-password`, `/api/auth/request-email-change` | Authenticated active member. | Signed-in member. | Password hash, password-changed timestamp, email-change token rows, member email. | Email send for email-change verification. | Auth.js session plus `requireActiveSessionUser()`; change-password can allow forced password-change sessions; email-change request is rate-limited. | Audit log rows for security-sensitive changes; logger on errors. | Current pattern is hand-rolled member guard. #613 should consider a shared active-member API helper. |
| `/api/applications/nominate` | Authenticated active member plus nomination token. | Existing member acting as nominator. | Application nomination token/status and member id. | Email/application workflow side effects in nomination service. | Auth.js session, active-account guard, Zod token validation. | Logger on unexpected errors. | Token is body-provided and session-bound by service logic. #614 should include token ownership/regression coverage if not already covered. |
| `/api/availability`, `/api/availability/check`, `/api/booking-policies/check`, `/api/promo-codes/available`, `/api/promo-codes/validate` | Authenticated active member. | Signed-in member. | Capacity, booking policies, promo definitions, age-tier data. | None directly. | Active-session checks; availability and promo validation use `rateLimiters.bookingQuery`. Zod validation on policy and promo inputs. On the multi-lodge availability/pricing reads (`/api/availability`, `/api/availability/check`, `/api/bookings/quote`, `/api/bookings/rooms`) the resolved lodge is passed through `isMemberEligibleToBookLodge` (mirroring the booking create path) so a `BOOKING_RESTRICTION`ed member gets `403` instead of reading a forbidden lodge's availability/pricing; admin on-behalf quotes bypass it as the audited override. | Logger on errors. | These are not anonymous in current code despite being booking-discovery shaped. #613 should keep member-read helpers distinct as this family grows. (Season CRUD now lives solely under `/api/admin/seasons`; the duplicate member-open `/api/seasons` route was removed in #1252.) |
| `/api/bookings`, `/api/bookings/quote`, `/api/bookings/drafts` | Authenticated active member. | Signed-in member creating, quoting, or reading draft bookings. | Booking, booking guest, capacity, cancellation, credit, promo, waitlist, payment-target data. | Email sends and Xero outbox queueing through booking services for some transitions. | Auth.js session, active-account guard, booking create/query rate limiters, Zod/date validation in services. | Logger and service-level audit/email side effects. | High-value business logic. #617 should review booking integrity and money/credit invariants. |
| `/api/bookings/[id]/**`, including cancel, modify, guests, payment confirmation, refund request, waitlist confirmation, notes, arrival time, and payment secret routes | Authenticated active member with route/service ownership checks. | Booking owner/member, sometimes admin through service rules. | Booking ownership, guest records, payment transactions, Stripe IDs/client secrets, cancellation/refund/change-request data, notes. | Stripe PaymentIntent/SetupIntent confirmation or retrieval, Xero invoice/credit-note outbox, email notifications. | Auth.js session, active-account guard, rate limits on cancel/change flows, service-level owner checks, Zod/date validation. | Audit logs for payment/guest/refund/change operations where implemented; logger on failures. | IDOR and money-state risk. #614 should include representative owner-boundary tests; #617 should review transaction invariants. |
| `/api/payments/options`, `/api/payments/charge-saved-method`, `/api/payments/create-payment-intent`, `/api/payments/create-setup-intent` | Authenticated active member. | Signed-in member discovering payment options, paying for booking, or saving payment method. | Payment method availability, payment, payment transaction, booking, Stripe customer/payment method/client secret references. | Stripe API for Stripe paths; Xero-backed Internet Banking availability is reported but settlement stays in Xero reconciliation. | Auth.js session, active-account guard, booking/payment service checks, module-state gates for Internet Banking. | Audit/logging around payment reconciliation and failure paths. | Client secret exposure is intentional to the owning member only. Internet Banking bookings must stay out of Stripe-only mutation paths; #617 should verify ownership checks and cents-only money handling. |
| `/api/profile`, `/api/notifications/preferences`, `/api/member/**` | Authenticated active member. | Signed-in member. | Member PII, address/phone/email preferences, audit log, credit balance, subscription status, onboarding, data export, deletion request, membership cancellation request/confirmation. | Email send, Xero contact/group update, export generation where invoked. | Auth.js session, active-account guard, rate limits for data export, deletion request, and cancellation request/confirmation. | Audit log for profile/security/deletion/cancellation operations; logger for Xero/email failures. | Member PII and lifecycle state. #614 should cover inactive/forced-password boundaries; #617 should review lifecycle integrity. |
| `/api/members/family/**` | Authenticated active member, usually family-group owner or adult login holder. | Signed-in member managing family relationships. | Family groups, invitations, child/adult join/removal requests, delegated non-login member details, inherited email, dependent records. | Email notifications and optional Xero contact/group sync. | Auth.js session, active-account guard, family request rate limiter, service-level ownership and adult/login-holder checks. | Audit log, logger, and email logs. | Family IDOR and shared-email risk. #614 should include a representative family-owned-resource boundary test. |
| `/api/issue-reports` | Authenticated active member. | Signed-in member reporting an issue. | Issue report text, screenshot metadata/storage path if captured, member id. | Email notification to admins. | Auth.js session, active-account guard, issue-report retention helpers. | Audit log and logger. | Not anonymous in current code. #615 should only treat it as public if the implementation changes. |
| `/api/chores/[token]` | Public opaque token. | Guest with chore link. | Guest chore assignment for one token/date. | None. | `rateLimiters.guestChoreToken`; token validation; `PUT` explicitly returns 405. | None. | Token URL can be logged or forwarded. Existing mitigation is rate limit and token expiry. Keep in public allowlist. |
| `/api/chores/roster/[date]/print` | Authenticated active member. | Member needing printable roster. | Roster/booking guest data for a date. | None. | Auth.js session, active-account guard, date validation via services. | None. | Data visibility should remain bounded to lodge/booking expectations. #618 can review lodge/roster exposure. |
| `/api/lodge/access`, `/api/lodge/pin-login`, `/api/lodge/guests/[date]/**`, `/api/lodge/roster/[date]/**` | Lodge guard or PIN login flow. `pin-login` starts a hut-leader PIN session behind an authenticated lodge/admin path. | Lodge account, admin, member with kiosk access, hut leader PIN session. | Lodge guest list, arrival/departure, roster chores, PIN session, audit records. | None. | `checkLodgeAuth()` for most routes, active-account guard, `rateLimiters.lodgePinLogin`, date scoping. The kiosk's lodge is resolved from its STAFF binding: exactly one grant binds, zero grants fall back to the default lodge, and a grant at **two or more lodges is ambiguous and denied** (`resolveKioskLodgeId` throws `AmbiguousKioskLodgeError`, which every kiosk data route maps to a clean `403` via `kioskLodgeAuthErrorResponse` rather than a 500; `pin-login` returns `403` directly) so a mis-selected double-grant cannot serve the default lodge's guest list/roster or accept its hut-leader PINs on the wrong property. | Audit log for arrival/departure and roster updates; logger for failures. | Shared lodge devices and PIN sessions have elevated operational risk. #618 should review kiosk session lifetime and device assumptions. |
| `/api/lodge-instructions` | Authenticated active member who is an admin or holds a current/upcoming hut-leader assignment (`canReadLodgeInstructions`). | Signed-in hut leader or admin. | Per-lodge operational documents (OPEN/CLOSE/DAY_TO_DAY), which may carry door codes and emergency access details. | None. | Active-session guard plus the reader gate. A requested `?lodgeId=` is constrained to the caller's own hut-leader assignment lodges (the assignment lodge set); an out-of-set lodge is `403`. Admins may request any lodge. Without this, the reader gate had no lodge dimension, so a lodge A hut leader could read lodge B's documents. | Logger on errors. | Reader-only surface; the admin editor lives under `/api/admin/lodge-instructions`. Assignment-scoped read keeps operational access details scoped to the lodge the leader actually runs. |
| `/api/admin/setup/**`, `/api/admin/modules`, `/api/admin/health`, `/api/admin/runtime-status` | Admin session. `runtime-status` now uses the shared `requireAdmin()` guard. | Admin. | Setup progress, provider readiness, module settings, health detail, runtime status. | Provider test route can check Stripe/email/Xero config when admin triggers it; health checks DB/Xero/SMTP/Stripe readiness. | Admin role plus active-account guard via `requireAdmin()`. | Audit logs for setup/progress/module changes; logger for provider/health errors. | Resolved under #613 (closed): `admin/runtime-status` uses `requireAdmin()`. Provider-test/setup guard standardisation is the remaining hardening item. |
| `/api/admin/members/**`, including dependents, family, lifecycle, setup invites, password resets, import/export, credits, Xero link/push/unlink | Admin session via the shared `requireAdmin()` guard (per-method test-enforced, #1132). | Admin. | Member PII, passwords/action tokens, family/dependent links, credits, lifecycle/archive/delete state, Xero contact links, import/export payloads. | Email sends, Xero contact/group sync, password setup/reset email. CSV setup invites are limited to imported rows that can log in. | Shared `requireAdmin()` guard on every method; import has rate limit; some credit/lifecycle routes import rate-limit helpers. | Extensive audit log for member, credit, lifecycle, and Xero actions; logger for failures. | Highest PII/IDOR blast radius. #613 should migrate to shared admin guard; #614 should guard missing admin checks; #617 should review lifecycle integrity. |
| `/api/admin/member-applications/**`, `/api/admin/membership-cancellation-requests/**`, `/api/admin/members/[id]/membership-cancellation`, `/api/admin/membership-cancellation-settings`, `/api/admin/deletion-requests/**` | Admin session via the shared `requireAdmin()` guard (per-method test-enforced, #1132). | Admin. | Applications, cancellation requests/participants/settings, deletion request state, member lifecycle action requests. | Email sends; cancellation approval can affect Xero contact groups/archive through services. | Admin role plus active guard; participant resend/approval routes import rate-limit helpers. | Audit log and logger. | Sensitive lifecycle and account deletion operations. #617 should review durable state transitions and external writes outside long transactions. |
| `/api/admin/bookings/**`, `/api/admin/booking-change-requests/**`, `/api/admin/booking-reviews`, `/api/admin/waitlist` | Admin session via the shared `requireAdmin()` guard (per-method test-enforced, #1132). | Admin. | Booking list/search/detail, operational payment/Xero/bed/change filters, review/force-confirm state, change requests, waitlist. | Email sends; Xero invoice/outbox; capacity/booking services. | Admin role plus active guard; route/service validation. | Audit logs for booking approvals/force-confirm/change-request decisions; logger. | Financial and reservation integrity surface. #613/#614 should standardize guard markers; #617 should review invariants. |
| `/api/admin/bed-allocation/**` | Admin session plus bed-allocation module capability. | Admin. | Lodge rooms, lodge beds, per-night guest allocations, allocation approvals, booking highlight/date-range filters. | None directly. | `requireBedAllocationAdmin()`, module-state gate, Zod/body validation through bed-allocation route helpers, service-level allocation uniqueness constraints. | Audit logs for room/bed/allocation/settings mutations and approval runs; logger on failures. | Reservation and shared-room integrity surface. Keep allocation writes synchronized with booking lifecycle and preserve per-guest date-only semantics. |
| `/api/admin/booking-policies/**`, `/api/admin/seasons/**`, `/api/admin/age-tier-settings`, `/api/admin/promo-codes/**` | Admin session via the shared `requireAdmin()` guard (per-method test-enforced, #1132). | Admin. | Booking policy settings, seasons/rates, age-tier settings, promo codes, Xero item/account mappings for promos. | Xero mapping reads/writes where promo/account mappings are touched. | Admin role plus active guard; Zod validation in several routes. | Audit logs for policy/rate/promo changes. | Money values must remain integer cents. #617 should review pricing/promo abuse and concurrent updates. |
| `/api/admin/payments/**`, `/api/admin/refund-requests/**`, `/api/admin/credit-approvals` | Admin session via the shared `requireAdmin()` guard (per-method test-enforced, #1132). | Admin. | Payments, refund requests, member credits, booking/payment reconciliation state. | Stripe refunds/charges as needed, Xero invoice/credit-note work, email notifications. | Admin role plus active guard; service-level validation. | Audit log, logger, email logs. | High money-movement risk. #617 should review cents-only invariants, idempotency, and external call placement. |
| `/api/admin/communications/**`, `/api/admin/email-templates/**`, `/api/admin/email-settings`, `/api/admin/email-suppressions/**`, `/api/admin/email-failures/**`, `/api/admin/notification-delivery-policies`, `/api/admin/notifications` | Admin session via the shared `requireAdmin()` guard (per-method test-enforced, #1132). | Admin. | Email templates/settings, send history, suppressions, notification preferences, email failure review. | SES/SMTP email send. | Admin role plus active guard; communications send is rate-limited. | Audit logs for template/settings/suppression/notification changes; logger. | Admin-triggered bulk email and template injection risk. #616 should review SES/email boundaries and redaction. |
| `/api/admin/audit-log`, `/api/admin/reports`, `/api/admin/members/export`, `/api/admin/members/import` | Admin session. | Admin. | Audit log, reports, member import/export data, bookings/payments/report aggregates. | Import may email login-enabled rows when invites are requested; non-login shared-email rows do not receive setup tokens. | Admin role plus active guard; import has API rate limit; exports select broad PII. | Logger and audit rows for import/export where implemented. | Large data extraction surface. #613/#614 should guard missing admin markers; #617/#619 should review export handling and storage. |
| `/api/admin/access-roles/**` | Admin session via the shared `requireAdmin()` guard (support area); create/update/delete additionally require Full Admin via an explicit `isFullAdmin` check inside the handlers, because an editable definition could otherwise widen itself past the area gate. | Full Admin for mutations; any admin with support view for the read/options list. | Access-role definitions: labels, descriptions, per-area permission matrices, holder counts. | None. | Zod validation; deletion returns 409 while any member holds the role (including bare enum rows) with a Restrict FK backstop; protected system roles have no definition rows and cannot be touched. | Critical-severity structured audit entries for create/update/delete with before/after definitions. | Permission definitions are security-critical configuration: an edit applies to every holder on their next request. Full-Admin-only management plus the separation-of-duties gate on assignments keeps scoped admins from widening access. |
| `/api/admin/lodge`, `/api/admin/chores/**`, `/api/admin/committee/**`, `/api/admin/hut-leaders/**`, `/api/admin/roster/**`, `/api/admin/issue-reports/**` | Admin session. | Admin. | Lodge config, chores, committee contacts, hut leader PIN/email data, roster, issue reports. | Email sends for hut-leader PIN/issue report workflows. | Shared `requireAdmin()` guard with active-account checks on every method. | Audit log for committee/issue/lodge changes; logger for failures. | Public-facing committee and lodge operational data. #618 should review kiosk and roster assumptions. |
| `/api/admin/xero/**` | Admin session plus Xero OAuth state for connect/callback. | Admin. | Operational Xero tokens, contact groups, account/item mappings, contact links, sync operations, inbound events, duplicate/contact mismatch snapshots, Xero API usage. | Xero API and OAuth. | Admin role plus active guard; OAuth callback validates state cookie; feature gates through proxy/module state for many Xero paths. | Audit log for mutating admin Xero actions, Xero operation logs, Xero inbound event records, logger. | Sensitive integration surface. #613 should standardize guards; #616 should review OAuth state, token encryption, retry/replay controls, and webhook reconciliation. |
| `/api/admin/lodges`, `/api/admin/lodges/[id]` | Admin session via the shared `requireAdmin()` guard (per-method test-enforced, #1132). Behind the `multiLodge` module route gate for the admin UI, but the data model is core (ADR-002) so the API is guarded on its own, not only gated. | Admin. | `Lodge` identity rows (name, slug, active, door code, travel note); the sole-active-lodge identity sync. | None. | Admin role plus active guard; Zod-validated strict schemas; deactivating the last active lodge is rejected with 409 (booking flows and the ADR-002 presentation rule assume one active lodge exists). | Structured audit logs for `LODGE_CREATED`/`LODGE_UPDATED`/`LODGE_ACTIVATED`/`LODGE_DEACTIVATED` with before/after identity. | Deactivation guards only the last-active-lodge case; it does not yet check future bookings, waitlist entries, hut-leader assignments, or kiosk STAFF bindings on the deactivated lodge (production-review §1.3). Kiosk/capacity resolvers do not read `Lodge.active`, so a kiosk bound to a deactivated lodge keeps operating. Door code and travel note are lodge-operational data behind the admin guard, not exposed on the member `/api/lodges` surface. |
| `/api/lodges` | Authenticated active member (Auth.js session plus `requireActiveSessionUser()`). Not admin-gated: it is the booking-flow lodge selector. | Signed-in member. | Active lodges the member is eligible to book — id, name, and travel note only. Door codes and operational settings are deliberately not selected. | None. | Active-session guard; per-lodge eligibility filter (`isMemberEligibleToBookLodge`) so a `BOOKING_RESTRICTION`ed member never sees lodges they cannot book; only `active` lodges returned. Response hides the selector client-side when one lodge is returned (ADR-002). | None beyond DB errors if thrown. | Public-ish member-read surface. Keep the select list to identity-only fields; door codes and per-lodge operational settings must stay out of this response. Eligibility is enforced server-side, not just hidden client-side. |
| `/api/admin/members/[id]/lodge-access` | Admin session via the shared `requireAdmin()` guard (per-method test-enforced, #1132). | Admin. | `MemberLodgeAccess` grant rows for one member: `BOOKING_RESTRICTION` rows (which lodges the member may book) and `STAFF` rows (kiosk-account lodge binding). | None. | Admin role plus active guard; Zod strict schema (max 50 lodge ids per kind); unknown lodge ids rejected 400; PUT replaces the member's rows for both kinds in one transaction. | Structured audit log `MEMBER_LODGE_ACCESS_UPDATED` recording previous and new lodge-id sets per kind. | **Authorization-granting surface.** Editing these rows changes what a member may book and which lodge a kiosk (STAFF) account binds to — it grants/removes access, so it must stay Full-admin-guarded and fully audited. A wrong STAFF grant re-homes a shared kiosk device to another lodge. No self-widening path exists (only admins reach it), but treat it as security-sensitive configuration like `access-roles`. |
| `/api/admin/bed-allocation/rooms/bulk`, `/api/admin/lockers/bulk` | Admin session. Rooms-bulk via `requireBedAllocationAdmin()` (admin plus the Bed Allocation module capability); lockers-bulk via the shared `requireAdmin()` guard. | Admin. | Bulk-created `LodgeRoom`/`LodgeBed` and `Locker` rows for a resolved active lodge. | None. | Admin/module guard; Zod strict schemas cap batch size (`MAX_BULK_ROOMS`, `MAX_BULK_BEDS_PER_ROOM`, `MAX_BULK_LOCKERS = 100`); target lodge validated active or 400; a clashing name prefix is rejected (409) before any rows are written; the whole batch is created in one transaction. | Structured audit logs `BED_ALLOCATION_ROOMS_BULK_CREATED` and `locker.bulk_created` with lodge id and counts. | Write-amplification surface: one admin call seeds many rows. Batch caps and transactional all-or-nothing creation bound the amplification; keep the caps in place and the clash pre-check ahead of the write. Name uniqueness is `[lodgeId, name]`; null-lodge rows still clash at every lodge until the contract release enforces NOT NULL. |

## External Integration Review (#616)

This review covered the current Stripe, operational Xero, finance reporting over
the operational Xero connection, SES/SNS, Sentry, OAuth state, webhook signature,
token encryption, and provider callback logging paths without live provider
calls.

Concrete hardening added from the review:

- Stripe, Xero, and SES/SNS webhooks now enforce bounded request bodies before
  provider verification or JSON parsing. Oversized payloads return `413`, while
  malformed signed payloads still return `400`/`401` as appropriate.
- Xero webhook JSON now requires an object payload with an array `events` value
  and caps a single delivery to 100 events before processing any event rows.
- Operational Xero OAuth callbacks still pass the exact registered callback URL
  to the Xero SDK, but logs now record only callback path and presence flags for
  `code`/`state`.
- Shared log/Sentry redaction now scrubs OAuth `code` and `state` query
  parameters, plus Sentry request URLs, query strings, breadcrumbs, exception
  values, and extra data.

Verified controls already present and intentionally preserved:

- Provider webhooks remain unauthenticated by session and rely on Stripe
  signature verification, Xero HMAC verification, and SNS signature plus topic
  allowlisting.
- Stripe and SES/SNS webhook handlers claim event ids before side effects and
  release the claim if downstream processing fails.
- Xero inbound events use correlation keys for replay/idempotency and keep
  reconciliation work outside the initial provider response path.
- Operational Xero token storage encrypts access and refresh tokens at rest.

Residual risks to keep visible:

- Webhook rate limiting remains provider-signature based rather than IP based.
- Xero webhook reconciliation still depends on stored tenant configuration and
  the async worker succeeding after the provider response.
- `SES_SNS_TOPIC_ARN` must stay configured outside local override scenarios.
- Full CI, production build, and deployed endpoint validation are intentionally
  left to GitHub Actions and approved deployment windows.

## Route Family Coverage

Every `src/app/api/**/route.ts` file is covered by one of these family rules.
The rules are intentionally broad enough to survive routine route additions but
specific enough for #614 to turn into static boundary tests.

These family rules are enforced by automated tests (issue #1132):

- `src/lib/__tests__/api-route-boundaries.test.ts` asserts per exported HTTP
  method that admin routes reach `requireAdmin()` (directly, via a local
  helper, or via an allowlisted shared wrapper), that finance routes call the
  viewer/manager guard documented for them, and that member routes carry an
  active-session guard unless explicitly documented as public.
- `src/lib/__tests__/admin-permissions.test.ts` enumerates every
  `src/app/api/admin/**` route and method from the filesystem and checks the
  resolved area/level requirement against a hand-written role-bundle truth
  table: anonymous, plain member, lodge, finance-viewer, and org identities
  must be denied everywhere, and each admin bundle must match the table. A new
  admin route that falls into the `/api/admin` overview catch-all (readable by
  every scoped admin bundle) fails the suite until it is mapped to a specific
  area or consciously allowlisted.
- `src/lib/__tests__/finance-api-auth.test.ts` behaviourally tests the
  `/api/finance` guard pair, including that a full `ADMIN` without a finance
  role is rejected (the finance surface is separate from the admin portal).

| Data store or secret class | Where it appears | Current controls | Follow-up |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Password hashes and session security fields | `Member.passwordHash`, `forcePasswordChange`, `passwordChangedAt`, Auth.js JWT callbacks. | bcrypt, email verification before session, session invalidation on password change. | #615 for account-recovery behavior; #617 for lifecycle interactions. |
| Action and verification tokens | Password reset, setup invite, verification, email change, nomination, chore, cancellation confirmation helpers. | Token helpers store hashes/expiry where implemented; some routes are session-bound in addition to token-bound. | #615 for token URL/log exposure and enumeration. |

## Threat Model By Actor

Issue pointers in this section (#613–#619) are provenance for the reviews
that hardened each actor path; all are closed. Open items are tracked in
labelled GitHub issues instead of this document.

### Anonymous Internet User

Main reachable surfaces are public health, public read endpoints, auth/account
recovery, contact/application forms, address autocomplete, public chore tokens,
and provider webhooks. Abuse goals include credential stuffing, account
enumeration, spam, upstream-cost exhaustion, token guessing, and availability
probing. Current mitigations are route-specific rate limits, Zod validation,
non-secret public health responses, token expiry, and provider signatures.

Rate limits are backed by a shared Postgres counter (`RateLimitCounter`,
one atomic upsert per check), so blue/green drain and any future multi-replica
routing share the same window (#1039). If the database is unreachable the
limiter degrades to the previous per-process in-memory counters rather than
failing requests. Public exceptions are now backed by route metadata and
static tests, but #615 should still review the concrete anonymous endpoint
behavior.

### Authenticated Member

Members can manage profile, bookings, payments, family relationships, data
export/deletion/cancellation requests, notifications, and issue reports. Abuse
goals include IDOR against another member's booking/family records, manipulating
payment or refund state, bypassing subscription/age-tier policies, or causing
external provider side effects through profile/booking changes.

Current mitigations are active-session checks, service-level ownership checks,
rate limits on high-risk self-service operations, and audit logs for sensitive
mutations. #614 should add representative IDOR tests; #617 should review money,
booking, and lifecycle integrity.

### Admin

Admins can read and mutate the largest surface: member PII, bookings, payments,
refunds, lifecycle actions, communication templates, setup state, module
controls, operational Xero, reports, imports, exports, and audit logs. Abuse
goals include unauthorized bulk export, account takeover through password/setup
invites, financial manipulation, lifecycle deletion/cancellation abuse, email
template abuse, and Xero data corruption.

Current mitigations are role checks, active-session checks in most routes,
auditing on many sensitive mutations, and provider/service validation. Residual
risk is inconsistent guard shape: some routes use `requireAdmin()` and many
hand-roll the check. #613 should standardize guards and #614 should fail new
admin routes that lack an approved guard marker.

### Finance Manager Or Viewer

Finance actors can view metrics/snapshots and managers can run finance sync.
Abuse goals include reading sensitive financial data without club-wide admin
rights, triggering expensive syncs, or syncing against the wrong operational
Xero tenant.

Current mitigations are separate finance access levels, active-session checks,
force-password-change checks, the shared admin-managed Xero connection, and
route-level viewer/manager split. #614 should test denial for ordinary
members/admins without finance access; #618 should review finance role
assignment and legacy dashboard behavior.

### Lodge Account Or Hut-Leader PIN Session

Lodge users operate shared-kiosk workflows around guest lists, arrivals,
departures, and chores. Abuse goals include using a shared device after the
intended period, viewing dates outside scope, or modifying roster/arrival state
without an accountable member.

Current mitigations are `checkLodgeAuth()`, active-account checks, date scoping,
PIN rate limits, and audit logs for operational changes. #618 should review PIN
session lifetime, shared-device assumptions, and roster data exposure.

### Cron Caller

Anyone with `CRON_SECRET` can trigger pending booking confirmation, payment
recovery, Xero maintenance, issue-report jobs, and deploy runtime status.
Abuse goals include repeated provider calls, email storms, payment recovery
side effects, and timing operational work.

Current mitigations are `x-cron-secret` checks, mostly constant-time compare,
task allowlists, module-state gates, and cron run logging for payment recovery.
Residual risk is duplicated secret-check code. #613 should centralize it and
#614 should test wrong, missing, and different-length secrets.

### External Integration

Stripe, Xero, and SES/SNS can call webhook endpoints. Abuse goals include
forged events, replayed events, malformed payloads, and high-volume callbacks.
Current mitigations are provider signatures, idempotency records for SES/SNS
processed events, Xero inbound correlation keys, webhook logs, and downstream
service validation.

Do not add session auth to these webhooks. #616 should review body size,
idempotency, replay behavior, topic allowlists, token encryption, and callback
URL redaction.

### Compromised Log Reader

A log reader may see structured app logs, reverse-proxy paths, webhook errors,
cron failures, callback URLs, or admin action metadata. Abuse goals include
recovering action tokens, OAuth codes/states, client secrets, email addresses,
or provider identifiers from logs.

Current mitigations include `redact-sensitive-json` coverage for known token URL
patterns, URL-encoded callback paths, and redaction in webhook error recording.
Residual risk remains for new token patterns and provider payloads that do not
pass through the same redaction path. #616 should include explicit provider
payload log redaction checks.

### Compromised CI Secret Or Deployment Secret

CI and deployment secrets can publish images, access GHCR, upload Sentry source
maps, deploy with environment files, or call cron/deploy endpoints. Abuse goals
include image substitution, secret exfiltration, malicious dependency changes,
and production runtime manipulation.

Current mitigations are GitHub Actions permission scoping, dependency audit,
Semgrep, gitleaks, Trivy, protected PR flow, Compose hardening
(`read_only`, `no-new-privileges`, resource limits), and documentation that
keeps `.env` and provider credentials out of git. #619 should review workflow
permissions, image provenance, package visibility, and deploy secret rotation.

## Public Endpoint Abuse Review - 2026-05-28

Reviewed the explicit public and token-bearing surfaces from this inventory:
Auth.js login, account recovery and verification routes, membership
applications, contact, public committee/age-tier reads, Addy autocomplete,
health/readiness, guest chore tokens, nomination tokens, membership
cancellation confirmation tokens, and group-booking join token flows. Booking
discovery, promo validation, and issue reports are authenticated active-member
routes in the current implementation, so they are not anonymous public
endpoints.

Hardening applied in #615:

- Public JSON routes now return explicit 400s for malformed JSON instead of
  falling into generic server errors for contact, forgot-password, reset-password,
  and resend-verification payloads.
- Action-token consumers now reject non-64-character hex tokens before hashing
  or lookup on password reset, email verification, email-change confirmation,
  guest chore links, nomination confirmation, and membership-cancellation
  confirmation.
- Addy autocomplete is module-gated, keeps session validation explicit, and caps
  returned search suggestions to the requested top 10. Malformed detail-session
  parameters fail locally before calling Addy.
- Public committee reads are capped to 50 active, published assignment records;
  email is server-only, contact keys are returned only for contactable
  assignments, member email can be used server-side only when no role email is
  configured, member phone is returned only when show-phone is enabled, and
  committee-routed contact EmailLog rows use opaque recipient markers.
- Log redaction covers token-bearing `/membership-cancellation/`, `/chores/`,
  `/nominations/`, `/pay/`, `/booking-requests/verify/`, and
  `/group-bookings/join/verify/` paths, including URL-encoded `callbackUrl`
  values from login redirects.
- The group-booking join-request mutation endpoint returns the same neutral
  success response for account-state and group-state lookup failures; the public
  group summary endpoint remains the intentional limited join-code lookup
  surface.

Accepted residual risk:

- Rate limits share a Postgres-backed counter across slots/replicas (#1039);
  during a database outage the limiter degrades to per-process counters, which
  briefly restores the old split-counter behaviour rather than blocking
  traffic.
- Membership application duplicate-account responses still reveal duplicate
  applicant/pending-application state. That is useful applicant feedback today,
  but should be revisited if public enumeration risk outweighs support value.
- Public health/readiness remain unauthenticated for load balancers and
  deployment checks; responses continue to expose only redacted status, version,
  uptime, and DB/config check state.

## Money, Booking, And Lifecycle Integrity Review - 2026-05-29

Reviewed current money, booking, and lifecycle state-machine paths for #617:
primary and modification PaymentIntent confirmation, saved-card charging,
payment recovery, direct refunds and refund webhooks, booking batch
modification settlement, waitlist force-confirm, cancellation, member
delete/archive lifecycle actions, membership cancellation approval, family
group changes, onboarding, and the Prisma models for bookings, payments,
refunds, recovery operations, and lifecycle requests.

Hardening applied in #617:

- Direct Stripe refund allocation now reconciles `PaymentTransaction`
  `refundedAmountCents` from the `PaymentRefund` ledger after recording or
  replaying the refund, and caps the local refunded total at the captured
  transaction amount. This keeps idempotent retries from double-counting a
  refund when a previous attempt already updated local transaction state but
  the caller retries the same Stripe refund.
- Stripe refund webhook sync and direct refunded-amount sync now use the same
  captured-amount cap before updating local transaction status.
- Bounded webhook body reads now fail closed on malformed `content-length`
  headers before provider verification or JSON parsing.
- Xero webhook events now require non-empty `eventType`, `eventCategory`, and
  `resourceId` values, and reject invalid `eventDateUtc` values before
  recording inbound rows. Empty `events` validation deliveries remain accepted.
- Operational Xero OAuth callbacks now require Xero to return an organisation
  tenant before encrypted access and refresh tokens are saved.
- Operational Xero callback redirects now show only safe local error messages;
  provider callback exception details are logged through the shared redaction
  layer and are not reflected into browser redirect URLs.

Verified controls already present and intentionally preserved:

- Booking payment success claims capacity inside the shared payment
  reconciliation transaction, refunds after capacity failure outside that
  transaction, and queues external Xero work after local state is durable.
- Stripe webhooks use Stripe signature verification and
  `ProcessedWebhookEvent` idempotency without session auth.
- Xero webhook reconciliation records signed inbound events first and runs
  provider reconciliation after the response path.
- Booking modification refund and additional-payment work happens after the
  booking mutation transaction, with recovery rows for failed refunds and
  cleanup/recovery for superseded PaymentIntents.
- Payment recovery operations claim rows before processing, reset stale
  processing rows, alert on exhausted retries, and use ledger totals for
  superseded-payment refund recovery.
- Member hard delete and archive approvals use second-admin review, lifecycle
  advisory locks, eligibility re-checks, and local link cleanup before
  approval is recorded.
- Membership cancellation approval requires a confirmed participant, blocks
  future owned bookings or guest appearances, disables login locally in the
  database transaction, and queues Xero cancellation work after commit.

Residual risks to keep visible:

- Cron-driven payment recovery remains an operational dependency for failed
  post-transaction Stripe cleanup.
- Webhook freshness/replay controls remain provider-event-id and Xero
  correlation-key based; they do not enforce a separate local delivery timestamp
  window.
- Operational Xero still chooses the first tenant returned by Xero during
  connection; operators must select the intended club organisation at consent.
- Money and date invariants are enforced mostly in application/service logic;
  this pass did not add database check constraints.
- External-provider side effects remain best-effort after local state commits
  and rely on outbox/recovery monitoring rather than synchronous rollback.

## Lodge, Finance, And Legacy Privileged Interface Review - 2026-05-29

Reviewed the current #618 surfaces: lodge/kiosk page gates, lodge guest and
roster APIs, hut-leader PIN login/session cookies, finance page and API guards,
finance sync routes, and the legacy finance dashboard bridge.

Hardening applied in #618:

- Hut-leader PIN session cookies created by `/api/lodge/pin-login` are now
  bound to the authenticated lodge/admin account that entered the PIN. The
  binding is HMAC-derived from the auth secret rather than stored as a plaintext
  account id, and lodge API requests reject a copied PIN cookie when it is sent
  by a different authenticated account.
- Staying-guest lodge-list responses keep their read-only lodge list view but
  no longer include adult member phone numbers. Operational tiers
  (`admin`, `lodge`, and `hut-leader`) still receive adult contact numbers for
  arrival/departure coordination.
- Manual finance sync failures no longer reflect raw backend exception text into
  `/finance` redirect query strings. The route logs the detail and redirects
  with a generic failed-sync notice.
- Legacy dashboard export failures no longer return raw backend exception text
  to callers. The bridge still requires finance viewer API access plus a bearer
  token, keeps the bearer comparison constant-time, and stores no bearer token in
  the database.

Verified controls already present and intentionally preserved:

- Finance access remains separate from `ADMIN`: `FINANCE_USER` can read finance
  pages/APIs and `FINANCE_ADMIN` is required for manager-only sync and mapping
  routes. Xero connection state is managed through the shared operational admin
  Xero connection, with `financeAccessLevel` kept synchronized only for legacy
  compatibility and ignored by runtime guards.
- `LODGE` alone is rejected by finance guards; deliberate mixed-role accounts
  such as `LODGE` plus `FINANCE_USER` retain lodge access and gain finance
  viewer access.
- Lodge mutation routes continue to reject `staying-guest` access for arrivals,
  departures, and chore toggles; roster generation and confirmation remain
  limited to `admin` or `hut-leader` tiers.
- Kiosk, chores, finance, Xero, and address autocomplete routes remain covered
  by effective module route gates in `src/config/feature-routes.ts` and
  `src/proxy.ts`.
- Leaving `LEGACY_DASHBOARD_EXPORT_TOKEN` unset disables the legacy export with
  a 503 response after finance viewer access succeeds.

Residual risks to keep visible:

- Lodge and admin shared-device sessions still depend on physical device
  control, sign-out habits, and the existing 12-hour hut-leader PIN session
  lifetime.
- Adult phone numbers remain available to operational lodge tiers because the
  current kiosk workflow uses them for same-day arrival/departure coordination.
- The legacy dashboard export remains a bearer-token bridge for compatibility;
  keep it disabled when the legacy dashboard is not actively used.

## CI, Dependency, Docker, And Deployment Hardening Review - 2026-05-29

Reviewed the current #619 supply-chain and deployment boundary: GitHub Actions
permissions, action and scanner versions, npm audit policy, Dependabot policy,
gitleaks/Semgrep/Trivy gates, Dockerfile runtime shape, Compose exposure, GHCR
image naming, and deployment environment contracts.

Hardening applied in #619:

- The Docker image security job no longer uses
  `aquasecurity/trivy-action@master`; both Trivy steps now use the explicit
  `v0.36.0` release tag.
- Semgrep now mounts the repository read-only and writes SARIF output to a
  dedicated `$RUNNER_TEMP` artifact mount.
- The pull-request gitleaks Docker scan now mounts the repository read-only.
- `docs/MAINTENANCE.md` now records the action pinning, scanner isolation,
  GHCR token, commit-SHA image tag, and Trivy severity policies.

Verified controls already present and intentionally preserved:

- Workflow default permissions are `contents: read`; only GHCR publishing on
  `main` gets `packages: write`.
- `verify` remains the only CI job that runs the full production build, and it
  uses fake/test provider values. Local Lightsail validation should stay
  lightweight unless explicitly approved.
- Semgrep uses a pinned `semgrep/semgrep:1.161.0` image, PR-diff gitleaks uses
  `ghcr.io/gitleaks/gitleaks:v8.28.0`, and the Dockerfile uses
  `node:24.15-alpine`.
- Dependabot checks npm, GitHub Actions, and Docker weekly, with Node runtime
  ignores keeping the app on Node 24 until the runtime policy changes.
- The final app container runs as `nextjs`, Compose uses read-only app
  filesystems, tmpfs cache/temp mounts, `no-new-privileges`, resource limits,
  and Caddy is the only public port exposure in the production stack.
- `.dockerignore` excludes `.env`, `.env.*`, `.git`, `node_modules`, `.next`,
  coverage, docs, and markdown from the Docker build context.
- GHCR app and migrate images are commit-SHA tagged, and production deployment
  resolves `origin/main` to select matching images.

Residual risks to keep visible:

- Most GitHub Actions remain pinned to released major tags rather than full
  commit SHAs so Dependabot and upstream patch releases can keep routine
  maintenance low-friction.
- HIGH Trivy findings remain warning-only; CRITICAL findings block. Promote
  HIGH to blocking later if the operational noise level is acceptable.
- The repo does not yet publish signed image attestations or SBOM artifacts.
  Current image provenance is protected PR checks plus commit-SHA GHCR tags.

## Follow-Up Mapping

- #613 - Standardize route guards: route metadata and shared active-session and
  cron/deploy helpers now exist; future batches should continue migrating
  hand-rolled admin checks to `requireAdmin()` or equivalent.
- #614 - Route boundary tests: static tests now walk `src/app/api/**/route.ts`
  and require approved guard markers or public allowlist entries; future batches
  should broaden IDOR behavior coverage for booking and family-owned resources.
- #615 - Anonymous public endpoints: first-pass hardening now covers token
  shape validation, malformed JSON behavior, Addy/committee response bounds, and
  token-path log redaction. Public committee/contact privacy now reads from
  published member-linked assignments, keeps email server-only, and gates phone
  by assignment flag. Remaining public-form policy tradeoffs are noted in the
  accepted residual risk above.
- #616 - External integrations: review Stripe, operational Xero, finance
  reporting through Xero, SES/SNS, Sentry, OAuth state handling, webhook
  signature/idempotency, token encryption, and provider callback logging.
- #617 - Money, booking, and lifecycle integrity: review cents-only money
  handling, payment/refund idempotency, booking ownership/settlement,
  cancellation/deletion/archive state, Xero outbox sequencing, and transaction
  boundaries.
- #618 - Lodge, finance, and legacy privileged interfaces: review completed;
  account-bound PIN sessions, staying-guest contact redaction, generic finance
  failure redirects, and generic legacy bridge 500s are now documented above.
- #619 - CI, dependency, Docker, and deployment hardening: review completed;
  Trivy pinning, read-only scanner mounts, action/dependency policy, image tag
  provenance, GHCR scope, and Compose residual risks are documented above.

## Wave-2 Verification Close-Out (epic #1204) - 2026-07-05

Re-audit of the wave-1 concurrency/integrity findings (#1127) against the fixed
code, plus the wave-2 security/integrity end state.

### Booking / person-night concurrency (#1127 F1-F4 — all resolved)

Every transaction that **creates or re-dates** a member-linked guest-night
footprint now takes the global booking advisory lock (`pg_advisory_xact_lock(1)`)
before running `assertNoBookingMemberNightConflicts`, and that lock-before-guard
ordering is frozen for every such writer by `review-findings-contracts.test.ts`:

- **F1** — `modifyBookingDates` (`booking-date-modification-service.ts`): guard
  added inside the locked transaction. Fixed by #1157.
- **F2/F3** — `approveBookingRequest` (`booking-request.ts`), the quote-hold path
  (`booking-request-quotes.ts`), and school-request approval
  (`school-booking-request.ts`): guard added inside each locked transaction.
  Fixed by #1158.
- **F4** — the contract test froze only two create paths and DOMAIN_INVARIANTS.md
  overstated the coverage. The test now freezes lock→guard ordering across all
  member-linked writers (`createDraftBooking`/`createConfirmedBooking`/
  `createWaitlistedBooking`, `modifyBookingDates`, `approveBookingRequest`, the
  quote-hold path, school-request approval, the `/bookings/[id]/guests` POST, and
  the delegated `modifyBookingBatch`→`prepareGuestPlan` path); the invariant doc
  is corrected to the footprint-scoped claim. Fixed by #1159.

Non-member group-join (`verifyAndCreateNonMemberJoin`) takes the lock but is a
guard no-op (writes only `memberId: null` guests) — correctly excluded, and
re-price / name-only / timestamp / anonymization writes skip the guard because
they do not change the member-night footprint. See DOMAIN_INVARIANTS.md.

### Money-path integrity (#1234)

Extended the money-path invariant defenses: **L1** repairs credit allocations
atomically under the booking advisory lock (`pg_advisory_xact_lock(1)`); **L2**
guards the supplementary-invoice path with an idempotency key, rejecting a
supplementary invoice when its `bookingModificationId` is absent. **L3 was
ratified as no-change**: the Xero outbox (`XeroSyncOperation`) deliberately keeps
**no** `@@unique` on `correlationKey`/`idempotencyKey` — a full unique would
reject a legitimate re-enqueue (a settled row from attempt 1 plus a fresh
`PENDING` retry) and break retries, so outbox dedup stays status-based (see the
by-design schema comment and the *Money, Booking, And Lifecycle Integrity Review*
above).

### Member-facing info-leak on the pay step (#1223)

Stripe initialization errors no longer surface the raw provider string (which can
carry partial `sk_*` key material) to members: the pay step shows generic copy,
and the raw detail reaches only Sentry (scrubbed by `beforeSend`) — never the DOM
**or** the member's browser console.

### Observability (#1214, decision D6)

Scoped `pino → Sentry` bridge on the cron + webhook loggers (deliberately not
global); the G5 observability gap is partially closed by design.

### Ratified trade-offs (epic decision menu, owner 2026-07-04)

- **D1 — CSP `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` + broad `img-src https:`: ratified.**
  Left in place; tightening `style-src` is a UI-wide project with regression risk
  disproportionate to the exposure. Revisit only if the HTML-sanitizer surface
  changes.
- **D2 — `getClientIp` trusting `x-real-ip`: ratified.** Removing it breaks
  non-Caddy deploys; the "Caddy always fronts" deployment invariant stands. The
  rate-limiter degraded mode (issue #1142) is documented above.
