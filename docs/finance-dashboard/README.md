# Finance Dashboard

The finance dashboard is the native AlpineClubBookingsNZ reporting workspace under
`/finance`. It uses AlpineClubBookingsNZ credentials, explicit finance access
roles, first-party booking data, and the single operational Xero connection.

## Access Model

- `FINANCE_USER` can read the finance workspace, reports, and finance viewer
  APIs.
- `FINANCE_ADMIN` can read finance data and trigger manager-only actions such
  as manual finance sync and finance report mapping writes.
- `USER`, `ADMIN`, and `LODGE` do not grant finance access by themselves.
- Mixed-role accounts are intentional: for example, `LODGE` plus
  `FINANCE_USER` can use lodge tools and read finance data, while lodge-only
  accounts remain blocked from finance pages and APIs.
- Admin Setup owns finance report mappings and historical backfill actions.
- Operational Xero setup remains an admin setup concern; `/finance` does not
  link to Xero connection management.
- `Member.financeAccessLevel` remains synchronized as `NONE`, `VIEWER`, or
  `MANAGER` only for compatibility visibility. Finance authorization reads
  `MemberAccessRole` rows only.

## Xero Connection

Finance reporting uses the single operational Xero connection that bookings,
payments, and subscriptions already use. There are no finance-specific Xero env
vars, token storage, callback routes, or usage metering. The connection is
managed through admin setup tooling, not from `/finance`.

The finance sync needs the granular `accounting.reports.profitandloss.read`,
`accounting.reports.balancesheet.read`, and
`accounting.reports.banksummary.read` scopes. After deploy, update the Xero
developer app allowed scopes, verify the redirect URI, then reconnect Xero once
from `/admin/xero` so existing tokens are replaced with tokens carrying the
current scope set. See `finance-xero-config-contract.md`.

Normal finance report navigation reads stored snapshots or first-party
AlpineClubBookingsNZ booking/payment data. It must not make live Xero calls on
page render.

## Dashboard Surface

`/finance` is the only finance UI route. It is controlled by query selectors:
`view`, `range`, custom `from`/`to` months, `compare`, custom comparison
months, `forward` (bookings view only), custom forward months, and the
costs-only `expenseCategoryId` and `expenseLine` filters.

The dashboard is **month-granular**: ranges are whole-month windows over the
monthly fact table (`last-month`, `last-3-months`, `last-6-months`,
`last-12-months`, `financial-year-to-date`, `last-financial-year`, or a custom
month range), and comparisons are `previous-period`, `same-period-last-year`,
`none`, or custom months. Financial-year ranges use the club's configured
year-end month (override → Xero organisation → 31 March default). Custom
params accept `YYYY-MM`; legacy `YYYY-MM-DD` bookmarks are clamped to their
containing month with a warning, and legacy option values (`last-quarter`,
`previous-month`, …) map onto their month-granular equivalents. The
in-progress month appears only in ranges that include it (e.g. financial year
to date) and is flagged as month-to-date. Day-level detail lives in Xero.

The default dashboard state is:

- view: Bookings
- range: Last Month
- compare: Previous Period
- forward: Next Month

The dashboard renders visual summaries only: KPI cards, trend charts (one
point per month, with the comparison period overlaid as a second series), mix
charts, reconciliation/status panels, compact source notes (the Xero-derived
views link to Xero's report centre for day-level drill-down), warnings, and
PDF/CSV exports for the active selection. Dashboard displays show whole
dollars with thousands separators; exact cents appear only where tie-out
matters (the reconciliation panel and CSV/PDF export rows). It does not render
daily detail tables or route users to the removed `/finance/*` report pages.

The revenue, costs, pricing-sensitivity, cash, working-capital, and
balance-sheet views read `FinanceAccountMonthlyBalance` facts (see
[finance-monthly-facts-contract.md](finance-monthly-facts-contract.md));
the bookings view reads local booking/payment data. The cash view's "latest
bank balance" KPI is the one figure still read from the daily bank-summary
snapshot, since it is a point-in-time value rather than a monthly one.

The **Ratios** view is the committee's comparison tool: a numerator dropdown
(any treasurer category, or Total income/expenses), an "as a percentage of"
denominator dropdown, and financial-year/range chips — e.g. catering cost as a
share of hut-fee income for this FY, last FY, and the FY before. The server
ships the full category-month matrix (`finance-ratio-insights.ts` /
client-safe helpers in `finance-ratio-shared.ts`), so switching pairings or
ranges recomputes instantly in the browser; the selection syncs to
`ratioNumerator`/`ratioDenominator`/`ratioRange` query params for shareable
links.
Divide-by-zero renders as "—". The revenue and costs views carry a compact
"Financial years" panel (this FY YTD vs the two prior FYs per group) that
links conceptually to the same data.

The **Xero Sync** view (`view=sync-health`) is the treasurer's
sync-confidence page: one traffic light aggregating the health signals the
platform already tracks — latest daily sync run, revenue reconciliation,
Xero operation outbox (failed/pending writes, bookings missing invoices,
refunds missing credit notes), and monthly fact freshness (latest sync time
and newest finalised month per statement kind). Red means a sync failed in
the last 24 hours, outbox operations have failed, or reconciliation does not
tie; amber covers pending operations, staleness over 36 hours, a finished
month still provisional-only, or an unavailable signal; green otherwise.
Signals link to the Xero admin console or the setup mappings panel. The view
is aggregation-only (`finance-sync-health.ts`) — it adds no sync logic and
never calls Xero live — and has no range/compare selectors.

## Data Model

- Xero-derived accounting datasets are persisted as `FinanceSnapshot` rows.
- Monthly per-account reporting facts (one row per statement kind, month, and
  Xero GL account code) are persisted in `FinanceAccountMonthlyBalance`,
  derived from multi-period profit-and-loss and balance-sheet pulls in the
  same daily sync. Historical coverage comes from the re-runnable backfill
  (`POST /api/finance/sync/backfill-monthly-facts` or
  `npm run finance:backfill-monthly-facts`). See
  [finance-monthly-facts-contract.md](finance-monthly-facts-contract.md).
- Daily sync is handled by the finance sync cron and durable service layer.
- Treasurer-controlled report groups are stored in `FinanceReportCategory` and
  `FinanceReportCategoryMapping`. Each group carries an optional `subtype`
  sub-heading and pins one or more Xero account codes; P&L lines are matched to
  groups by account code only. Unmapped P&L lines remain included in totals
  under `Unmapped`.
- Booking, occupancy, guest-night, and pricing-sensitivity reports use
  AlpineClubBookingsNZ booking/payment data directly.
- Finance API and page contracts are described in this directory so report
  definitions stay explicit.

the single `/finance` dashboard.

- [ADR-002: Finance access control](decisions/ADR-002-finance-access-control.md)
- [ADR-003: Separate finance Xero boundary (superseded by ADR-005)](decisions/ADR-003-separate-finance-xero-boundary.md)

- [ADR-005: Single operational Xero connection](decisions/ADR-005-single-operational-xero-connection.md)

## Maintenance Rules

- Update `data-contracts.md` before changing metric definitions.
- Do not grant finance access by broadening `ADMIN`; update ADR-002 first if
  the access model changes.
- The finance sync uses the single operational Xero connection; update ADR-005
  first if that changes.
- Keep report pages backed by snapshots or first-party AlpineClubBookingsNZ data unless a
  contract explicitly allows a live integration call.
