# Finance Dashboard Handoff

Last updated: 2026-04-22

## Current State

- Phase 1 finance access boundary landed via task `#101`
- Merged implementation PR: `#102`
- Planning scaffold task `#103` landed via PR `#104`
- Phase `#93` is closed
- Phase `#94` is closed
- Phase `#95` is closed
- Phase `#96` is closed
- Phase `#97` is closed
- Phase `#98` is closed
- Active phase: `#99`
- Most recent landed task: `#138`
- Merged implementation PR for `#138`: `#141`
- Finance task currently in flight: `#140` (implemented and validated locally, not yet published)
- Single `status: ready` finance task: `#140`
- Operational Xero remains closed on `main`; `docs/XERO_HANDOFF.md` stays unchanged unless new evidence proves a new gap

## What Landed Through Task #138

- Added `src/lib/__tests__/finance-report-output-validation.test.ts` with representative end-to-end validation coverage that exercises the native bookings and revenue report loaders against the landed booking-metrics and finance-snapshot boundaries
- Hardened `src/lib/finance-revenue-report-page.ts` so malformed `periods` query values such as `6abc`, `3.5`, and `1e2` now fail closed to the default six-period window instead of silently truncating into the wrong snapshot range
- Tightened singular report copy in `src/lib/finance-bookings-report-page.ts` so viewer-facing payment and at-risk pipeline messages stay grammatically correct when validation fixtures cover single-booking cases
- Captured durable phase `#98` validation evidence for representative `/finance/bookings` realized/forward totals and `/finance/revenue` snapshot-backed totals without broadening into phase `#99` reporting work

## Local In-Progress State (#140)

- Added `src/lib/finance-cash-report-page.ts` as the finance cash report loader/model boundary for durable `BANK_BALANCES` snapshot reads, safe period-filter fallback handling, bank-balance parsing, and viewer-safe unavailable states
- Added `src/app/(finance)/finance/cash/page.tsx` for a native `/finance/cash` report page with summary cards, stored snapshot detail, and bank-account comparison tables
- Updated `src/app/(finance)/finance/page.tsx` so the finance landing page links directly into the new cash report
- Added `src/lib/__tests__/finance-cash-report-page.test.ts` for targeted cash-report loader coverage, invalid-period fallback handling, and safe unavailable states
- Added `docs/finance-dashboard/finance-cash-report-contract.md` and indexed it from `docs/finance-dashboard/README.md`
- Updated `docs/finance-dashboard/data-contracts.md` with the native cash-reporting source-ownership boundary for `BANK_BALANCES`
- Verified the local implementation with focused Vitest, focused ESLint, `git diff --check`, and `npm run build`
- Current workspace state is code-complete for task `#140`, but the task has not been committed, pushed, merged, or closed in GitHub yet

## Implemented Guard Strategy

- `Member.financeAccessLevel` is the dedicated finance gate, separate from `role`
- finance access is checked server-side from the live `Member` row, not the JWT alone
- `/finance` lives outside the admin-only layout
- unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login` with a `/finance` callback
- users without finance access are redirected to `/dashboard`
- finance viewer and manager checks are separated in `src/lib/finance-auth.ts`

- Closed task `#115` as completed
- Created follow-up task `#118` under Phase `#95` for first finance Xero snapshot dataset handlers
- Marked `#118` as the single finance task with `status: ready`
- Kept diagnostics UI, manual sync route handlers, reporting-page work, and `docs/XERO_HANDOFF.md` out of scope
- Replaced the bootstrap dataset seam in `src/lib/finance-sync-datasets.ts` with the first concrete finance Xero report handlers for:
  - `PROFIT_AND_LOSS_MONTHLY`
  - `BALANCE_SHEET`
  - `BANK_BALANCES`

- Updated `docs/finance-dashboard/finance-sync-service-contract.md` and `docs/finance-dashboard/finance-sync-cron-contract.md` for the landed first report-based dataset surface
- Fixed the finance sync build blockers that surfaced during PR `#119` by:
  - wrapping the new Xero report calls with `callXeroApi` so the wrapper audit stays green
  - normalizing finance sync run summaries into Prisma JSON-safe objects
  - relaxing the storage input status annotation to the generated `FinanceSyncRunStatus` union while keeping the runtime guard intact
- Merged task `#118` to `main` via PR `#119`
- Closed task `#118` as completed
- Created follow-up task `#120` under Phase `#95` for a single aged receivables dataset handler
- Marked `#120` as the single finance task with `status: ready`
- Investigated task `#120` against the current repo Xero client surface and kept diagnostics UI, manual sync APIs, reporting pages, booking-adapter work, and `docs/XERO_HANDOFF.md` out of scope
- Confirmed the generated Xero Accounting API client in this repo only exposes `getReportAgedReceivablesByContact(xeroTenantId, contactId, date?, fromDate?, toDate?)`
- Confirmed the generated client marks `contactId` as required, so the current task cannot fetch an organisation-wide aged receivables snapshot without either:
  - broadening into contact enumeration or invoice-detail precursor work, or
  - relying on unverified raw API behavior outside the generated client contract
- Verified the official Xero Node accounting docs still document `contactId` as required for `/Reports/AgedReceivablesByContact`
- Re-scoped issue `#120` so the next implementation session is expected to self-resolve the current Xero API mismatch instead of stopping at the first SDK-level blocker
- Restored `status: ready` to issue `#120` after tightening the task around autonomous, production-ready delivery
- Updated the finance epic/phase/task wording plus this handoff prompt so overnight runs are expected to keep working until the feature is mergeable unless a true external blocker remains after exhausting repo and official API evidence

- Registered the `AGED_RECEIVABLES` scheduled dataset in `src/lib/finance-sync-datasets.ts`
- Extended `src/lib/finance-sync-xero-datasets.ts` with:
  - finance-only open-invoice pagination for Xero `ACCREC` invoices

  - `AGED_PAYABLES` from open Xero `ACCPAY` invoices
- Extended `src/lib/__tests__/finance-sync-datasets.test.ts` and `src/lib/__tests__/finance-sync-service.test.ts` for aged payables mapping, dataset registration, orchestration, and finance metering coverage

- Verified issue `#140` is open with labels `area: finance`, `type: task`, and `status: ready`
- Verified no other open finance task is marked `status: ready`

What remains:
- Publish and land the already-implemented local task `#140` changes, then close `#140` once the code is actually merged or otherwise fully landed in GitHub
- After `#140` lands, create the next smallest phase `#99` finance task and ensure it is the only open task carrying `status: ready`
- Leave working-capital rollups, balance-sheet pages, costs reporting, manual sync mutations, and operational Xero behavior for later work unless current evidence proves a gap

Blockers:
- None currently.

Use the GitHub workflow for TACBookings finance epic #92.

Work on exactly one task issue only.

1. Read only these sources first:
- docs/finance-dashboard/handoff.md
- docs/finance-dashboard/data-contracts.md
- ready task issue #140
- local `git status --short --branch`
- local diff for:
  - `src/lib/finance-cash-report-page.ts`
  - `src/app/(finance)/finance/cash/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(finance)/finance/page.tsx`
  - `src/lib/__tests__/finance-cash-report-page.test.ts`
  - `docs/finance-dashboard/finance-cash-report-contract.md`

2. Finish landing task `#140` from the already-implemented local workspace state:
- review the existing local `/finance/cash` implementation and validation output before changing anything
- keep the task on the native cash balances report backed by `BANK_BALANCES` snapshots only
- if a narrow fix is still needed after review, keep it within the current cash-report scope and re-run the targeted validation plus `npm run build`
- if no further code changes are needed, commit/push/open the PR for `#140` using the local implementation that is already present in the workspace
- close task `#140` only after the implementation is merged or otherwise fully landed in GitHub
- keep docs/XERO_HANDOFF.md unchanged unless current evidence proves a new operational Xero gap

3. Scope the next task tightly:
- do not start a second finance task until `#140` is fully landed
- do not combine the publication step with balance-sheet pages, costs reporting, working-capital rollups, charts, or manual sync work
- do not broaden the current code beyond the minimum needed to ship the native cash balances report safely; speculative schema work and operational Xero changes remain out of scope
- do not reopen operational Xero work unless current evidence proves a new gap

4. Before finishing:
- update docs/finance-dashboard/handoff.md with what landed, what remains, blockers, validation, and the next exact Next Prompt block
- run the targeted tests/lint for touched files and run `npm run build` if runtime paths changed
- if `#140` lands, close it and create the next smallest phase `#99` task so exactly one open finance task carries `status: ready`
- otherwise leave `#140` open and avoid creating the next task prematurely
- leave docs/XERO_HANDOFF.md unchanged unless new evidence forces it open

5. Work on exactly one task issue only.
