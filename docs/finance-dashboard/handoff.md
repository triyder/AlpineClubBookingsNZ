## What Landed Through Task #138

- Added `src/lib/__tests__/finance-report-output-validation.test.ts` with representative end-to-end validation coverage that exercises the native bookings and revenue report loaders against the landed booking-metrics and finance-snapshot boundaries
- Hardened `src/lib/finance-revenue-report-page.ts` so malformed `periods` query values such as `6abc`, `3.5`, and `1e2` now fail closed to the default six-period window instead of silently truncating into the wrong snapshot range
- Tightened singular report copy in `src/lib/finance-bookings-report-page.ts` so viewer-facing payment and at-risk pipeline messages stay grammatically correct when validation fixtures cover single-booking cases
- Captured durable phase `#98` validation evidence for representative `/finance/bookings` realized/forward totals and `/finance/revenue` snapshot-backed totals without broadening into phase `#99` reporting work

## What Landed Through Task #140

- Added `src/lib/finance-cash-report-page.ts` as the finance cash report loader/model boundary for durable `BANK_BALANCES` snapshot reads, safe period-filter fallback handling, bank-balance parsing, and viewer-safe unavailable states
- Added `src/app/(finance)/finance/cash/page.tsx` for a native `/finance/cash` report page with summary cards, stored snapshot detail, and bank-account comparison tables
- Updated `src/app/(finance)/finance/page.tsx` so the finance landing page links directly into the new cash report
- Added `src/lib/__tests__/finance-cash-report-page.test.ts` for targeted cash-report loader coverage, invalid-period fallback handling, and safe unavailable states
- Added `docs/finance-dashboard/finance-cash-report-contract.md` and indexed it from `docs/finance-dashboard/README.md`
- Updated `docs/finance-dashboard/data-contracts.md` with the native cash-reporting source-ownership boundary for `BANK_BALANCES`
- Published task `#140` via PR `#142` and merged it to `main`
- Closed task `#140` as completed and created follow-up task `#143` as the single open finance task carrying `status: ready`

## What Landed Through Task #143

- Added `src/lib/finance-balance-sheet-report-page.ts` as the finance balance-sheet report loader/model boundary for durable `BALANCE_SHEET` snapshot reads, safe period-filter fallback handling, section-total parsing, line-item aggregation, and viewer-safe unavailable states
- Added `src/app/(finance)/finance/balance-sheet/page.tsx` for a native `/finance/balance-sheet` report page with summary cards, stored snapshot detail, and grouped balance-sheet line-item comparisons
- Updated `src/app/(finance)/finance/page.tsx` so the finance landing page links directly into the new balance-sheet report
- Added `src/lib/__tests__/finance-balance-sheet-report-page.test.ts` for targeted balance-sheet report loader coverage, invalid-period fallback handling, and safe unavailable states
- Added `docs/finance-dashboard/finance-balance-sheet-report-contract.md` and updated `docs/finance-dashboard/data-contracts.md` for the landed balance-sheet reporting boundary
- Closed task `#143` as completed and created follow-up task `#144` as the single open finance task carrying `status: ready`

## What Landed Through Task #144

- Added `src/lib/finance-costs-report-page.ts` as the finance costs report loader/model boundary for durable `PROFIT_AND_LOSS_MONTHLY` snapshot reads, safe period-filter fallback handling, cost-section parsing, grouped line-item aggregation, and viewer-safe unavailable states
- Added `src/app/(finance)/finance/costs/page.tsx` for a native `/finance/costs` report page with summary cards, monthly snapshot detail, and grouped cost line-item comparisons
- Updated `src/app/(finance)/finance/page.tsx` so the finance landing page links directly into the new costs report
- Added `src/lib/__tests__/finance-costs-report-page.test.ts` for targeted costs-report loader coverage, invalid-period fallback handling, and safe unavailable states
- Added `docs/finance-dashboard/finance-costs-report-contract.md`, indexed it from `docs/finance-dashboard/README.md`, and updated `docs/finance-dashboard/data-contracts.md` with the native costs-reporting source-ownership boundary
- Closed task `#144` as completed and created follow-up task `#146` as the single open finance task carrying `status: ready`

## Implemented Guard Strategy

- `Member.financeAccessLevel` is the dedicated finance gate, separate from `role`
- finance access is checked server-side from the live `Member` row, not the JWT alone
- `/finance` lives outside the admin-only layout
- unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login` with a `/finance` callback
- users without finance access are redirected to `/dashboard`
- finance viewer and manager checks are separated in `src/lib/finance-auth.ts`

- Replaced the bootstrap dataset seam in `src/lib/finance-sync-datasets.ts` with the first concrete finance Xero report handlers for:
  - `PROFIT_AND_LOSS_MONTHLY`
  - `BALANCE_SHEET`

- Merged task `#118` to `main` via PR `#119`
- Closed task `#118` as completed
- Created follow-up task `#120` under Phase `#95` for a single aged receivables dataset handler
- Marked `#120` as the single finance task with `status: ready`
- Investigated task `#120` against the current repo Xero client surface and kept diagnostics UI, manual sync APIs, reporting pages, booking-adapter work, and `docs/XERO_HANDOFF.md` out of scope
- Confirmed the generated Xero Accounting API client in this repo only exposes `getReportAgedReceivablesByContact(xeroTenantId, contactId, date?, fromDate?, toDate?)`
- Confirmed the generated client marks `contactId` as required, so the current task cannot fetch an organisation-wide aged receivables snapshot without either:
  - broadening into contact enumeration or invoice-detail precursor work, or
  - relying on unverified raw API behavior outside the generated client contract
- Verified the official Xero Node accounting docs still document `contactId` as required for `/Reports/AgedReceivablesByContact`
- Re-scoped issue `#120` so the next implementation session is expected to self-resolve the current Xero API mismatch instead of stopping at the first SDK-level blocker
- Restored `status: ready` to issue `#120` after tightening the task around autonomous, production-ready delivery
- Updated the finance epic/phase/task wording plus this handoff prompt so overnight runs are expected to keep working until the feature is mergeable unless a true external blocker remains after exhausting repo and official API evidence

  - `AGED_PAYABLES` from open Xero `ACCPAY` invoices
- Extended `src/lib/__tests__/finance-sync-datasets.test.ts` and `src/lib/__tests__/finance-sync-service.test.ts` for aged payables mapping, dataset registration, orchestration, and finance metering coverage

- Verified `git diff --check`
- Verified draft PR `#148` is published for task `#146`
- Verified issue `#146` is closed as completed
- Verified no other open finance task is marked `status: ready`

What landed:
- Published task `#146` via draft PR `#148`
- Closed issue `#146` as completed after publishing the validation-only change
- Added `src/lib/__tests__/finance-phase99-report-output-validation.test.ts` with representative phase `#99` validation coverage for the native `/finance/cash`, `/finance/balance-sheet`, and `/finance/costs` report loaders
- Captured durable in-repo evidence that the landed cash report output stays aligned with stored `BANK_BALANCES` snapshot totals and account-level summary rows for representative periods
- Captured durable in-repo evidence that the landed balance-sheet report output stays aligned with stored `BALANCE_SHEET` snapshot totals and grouped line-item detail for representative periods
- Captured durable in-repo evidence that the landed costs report output stays aligned with stored `PROFIT_AND_LOSS_MONTHLY` snapshot totals and grouped cost-line detail for representative periods
- Confirmed the representative phase `#99` validation pass did not expose a narrow loader discrepancy, so no runtime report-page changes were required in the same slice
- Reassessed the next smallest phase `#99` follow-up after `#146` and created task `#151` as the smallest implementation-ready pricing-sensitivity slice
- Added `src/lib/finance-pricing-sensitivity-page.ts` as the native pricing-sensitivity loader/model boundary that combines stored `PROFIT_AND_LOSS_MONTHLY` finance snapshots with TACBookings realized booking metrics
- Added `src/app/(finance)/finance/pricing-sensitivity/page.tsx` for a native `/finance/pricing-sensitivity` report page with summary cards, monthly comparison detail, and explicit occupancy-assumption scenario rows
- Updated `src/app/(finance)/finance/page.tsx` so the finance landing page links into the new pricing-sensitivity report
- Reused the landed monthly cost parsing seam by exporting the narrow snapshot summary helper from `src/lib/finance-costs-report-page.ts`
- Added `src/lib/__tests__/finance-pricing-sensitivity-page.test.ts` for matched monthly window coverage, scenario math, invalid-filter fallback handling, and fail-soft month skipping
- Added `docs/finance-dashboard/finance-pricing-sensitivity-report-contract.md` and updated `docs/finance-dashboard/README.md` plus `docs/finance-dashboard/data-contracts.md` for the explicit pricing-sensitivity contract and non-goals
- Opened draft PR `#152` for task `#151`
- Removed `status: ready` from issue `#151` and moved it to `status: in-progress` once the work was pushed to PR `#152`
- Validated the task diff with:
  - `npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/finance-pricing-sensitivity-page.test.ts src/lib/__tests__/finance-costs-report-page.test.ts`
  - `npx eslint 'src/app/(finance)/finance/pricing-sensitivity/page.tsx' src/app/'(finance)'/finance/page.tsx src/lib/finance-pricing-sensitivity-page.ts src/lib/finance-costs-report-page.ts src/lib/__tests__/finance-pricing-sensitivity-page.test.ts`
  - `git diff --check`
  - `npm run build` after temporarily stashing unrelated local admin-Xero workspace changes that are outside task `#151` and not part of PR `#152`
- Merged PR `#152` into `main`
- Closed task `#151` as completed with a minimal Done/Validation/Next/Blockers issue comment
- Added a short phase-progress comment to issue `#99`
- Reassessed the next smallest concrete phase `#99` follow-up and created task `#153` as the single `status: ready` finance task for the native working-capital report shell
- Added `src/lib/finance-working-capital-report-page.ts` as the native working-capital loader/model boundary backed by stored `BALANCE_SHEET` finance snapshots and the landed balance-sheet parsing seam
- Added `src/app/(finance)/finance/working-capital/page.tsx` for a native `/finance/working-capital` report page with summary cards, explicit current-section assumptions, and stored period comparison detail
- Extended `src/lib/finance-balance-sheet-report-page.ts` with the narrow exported snapshot parser reused by the new working-capital page for current-asset and current-liability section totals
- Updated `src/app/(finance)/finance/page.tsx` so the finance landing page links into the new working-capital report
- Added `src/lib/__tests__/finance-working-capital-report-page.test.ts` for current-section parsing, current-ratio handling, invalid-filter fallback, and fail-soft snapshot skipping coverage
- Added `docs/finance-dashboard/finance-working-capital-report-contract.md` and updated `docs/finance-dashboard/README.md` plus `docs/finance-dashboard/data-contracts.md` for the explicit working-capital contract and non-goals
- Opened draft PR `#156` for task `#153`
- Added `status: in-progress` to issue `#153` and left a minimal implementation-progress comment there
- Validated the task diff with:
  - `npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/finance-working-capital-report-page.test.ts src/lib/__tests__/finance-balance-sheet-report-page.test.ts`
  - `npx eslint 'src/app/(finance)/finance/working-capital/page.tsx' src/app/'(finance)'/finance/page.tsx src/lib/finance-working-capital-report-page.ts src/lib/finance-balance-sheet-report-page.ts src/lib/__tests__/finance-working-capital-report-page.test.ts`
  - `git diff --check`
  - `npm run build` after temporarily applying the finance diff in the main checkout because Turbopack rejects a worktree-local `node_modules` symlink outside the project root, then restoring the unrelated admin-Xero WIP state
- Merged PR `#156` into `main` as commit `8b970c8`
- Deleted remote branch `finance/issue-153-working-capital-report-shell` after the squash merge
- Closed task `#153` as completed and removed its `status: in-progress` label
- Closed phase `#99` as completed now that the native finance reporting slice is landed
- Created task `#158` as the single `status: ready` finance task for the phase `#100` rollout and cutover checklist boundary
- Picked up task `#158` and moved it from `status: ready` to `status: in-progress`
- Added `docs/finance-dashboard/finance-rollout-cutover-checklist.md` with the minimum phase `#100` rollout boundary: entry criteria, explicit UAT gates, cutover steps, rollback notes, and legacy-dashboard freeze criteria
- Updated `docs/finance-dashboard/README.md` to index the new rollout checklist
- Opened draft PR `#160` for task `#158`
- Validated the docs-only diff with `git diff --check`

What remains:
- Review draft PR `#160` and merge it only if the diff stays scoped to the rollout checklist docs, no blocker comments appear, and no newer `main` change requires a rebase
- Reassess the next smallest concrete phase `#100` follow-up only after task `#158` lands

Blockers:
- None on the finance dashboard path itself
- `origin/main` moved after the branch was created via admin-Xero PR `#157`; it does not overlap the finance docs, but recheck branch freshness before merging PR `#160`
- The shared local workspace still contains unrelated admin-Xero history; keep finance follow-up work on a clean checkout or worktree

Use the GitHub workflow for TACBookings finance epic #92.

Run the merge-review stage for the current active finance PR only.

1. Read only these sources first:
- docs/finance-dashboard/README.md
- docs/finance-dashboard/handoff.md
- phase issue #100
- task issue #158
- draft PR #160

Read docs/finance-dashboard/phases.md and docs/finance-dashboard/test-plan.md only if a review comment or blocker requires rechecking rollout gates.
Read docs/finance-dashboard/data-contracts.md only if a review comment needs an exact source-of-truth reference for a landed finance surface.
Read docs/XERO_HANDOFF.md only if a review comment or blocker would reopen Xero-specific operational scope.

2. Verify all merge gates:
- task `#158` acceptance criteria are complete
- local validation still covers `git diff --check`
- PR `#160` has no blocker comments or requested changes
- branch `finance/issue-158-rollout-checklist` is up to date with `main`
- the diff stays scoped to:
  - `docs/finance-dashboard/finance-rollout-cutover-checklist.md`
  - `docs/finance-dashboard/README.md`
  - `docs/finance-dashboard/handoff.md`

3. If any gate fails:
- do not merge
- leave a short blocker note on PR `#160`
- update `docs/finance-dashboard/handoff.md` with the exact failing gate and next action
- keep finance work on a clean checkout or worktree instead of the unrelated admin-Xero history

4. If all gates pass:
- squash merge PR `#160`
- delete remote branch `finance/issue-158-rollout-checklist`
- close task issue `#158` with a minimal Done/Validation/Next/Blockers comment
- add a short progress comment to phase issue `#100`
- only create the next `status: ready` finance task if the remaining phase `#100` scope can be expressed as a concrete, production-ready slice

5. Keep handoff minimal:
- Done:
- Validation:
- Next:
- Blockers:
