# Finance Rollout and Cutover Checklist

This document is the minimum pre-cutover checklist for phase `#100`.

It defines what must be true before named-user rollout, how to run final UAT against the landed finance surface, how to roll back safely, and when the legacy dashboard can move from primary workspace to fallback path.

Once named-user rollout begins, continue with [finance-legacy-freeze-monitoring-runbook.md](/home/ubuntu/TACBookings/docs/finance-dashboard/finance-legacy-freeze-monitoring-runbook.md) and capture the operating record in [finance-post-cutover-evidence-template.md](/home/ubuntu/TACBookings/docs/finance-dashboard/finance-post-cutover-evidence-template.md).

This document does not itself execute rollout, change access, or retire the legacy dashboard.

## Scope Boundary

- Covers only the finance rollout readiness for the phase `#93` through `#99` work already landed on `main`
- Keeps operational Xero out of scope unless current implementation evidence proves a new gap
- Treats the legacy dashboard as required rollback coverage until the freeze criteria below are met

## Entry Criteria Before UAT

- Phase `#93` through phase `#99` are merged and closed, and the native finance workspace is available on `main`
- The rollout owner and rollback owner are identified before any named-user access change
- The named finance viewer and finance manager list is approved
- Production env wiring includes the finance-only Xero settings, not just the operational Xero settings:
  - `FINANCE_XERO_CLIENT_ID`
  - `FINANCE_XERO_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - `FINANCE_XERO_REDIRECT_URI`
  - `FINANCE_XERO_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- `FINANCE_XERO_REDIRECT_URI` matches the live TACBookings finance callback path and production domain
- The finance Xero OAuth app includes the finance reporting scope set:
  `openid profile email accounting.contacts accounting.invoices accounting.payments accounting.settings.read accounting.reports.read offline_access`
- Prisma migrations that create finance snapshot and finance token tables are deployed in the target environment
- The daily finance sync cron remains registered and enabled in the deployed runtime
- Finance sync diagnostics show a recent successful run with no unresolved repeated failures
- Representative snapshot periods are available for bookings, revenue, costs, cash, balance sheet, pricing sensitivity, and working capital validation
- The manual comparison window against the legacy dashboard is chosen before UAT starts

## UAT Checklist

### Access and Security

- An approved finance viewer can sign in and open `/finance`
- An approved finance viewer can open the landed native report routes:
  - `/finance/bookings`
  - `/finance/revenue`
  - `/finance/costs`
  - `/finance/pricing-sensitivity`
  - `/finance/cash`
  - `/finance/balance-sheet`
  - `/finance/working-capital`
- An ordinary member cannot open `/finance`
- A finance viewer cannot execute finance manager actions
- An admin without finance access does not receive finance access implicitly

### Sync and Observability

- Finance Xero connection status is healthy from the finance-manager surface
- Finance Xero shows the correct operational state for managers:
  - setup blocked when finance env/config is missing
  - ready to connect when config is complete but no tenant is linked yet
  - connected when a finance tenant is linked
  - reconnect required if the saved connection is incomplete or invalid
- The latest finance sync completed successfully and exposes usable timestamps and dataset coverage
- If no finance snapshots exist yet, the finance UI explains that the first finance sync still needs to run instead of reading as a broken page
- Failures remain visible from finance diagnostics with enough detail to route follow-up work
- Repeated syncs remain overlap-safe
- Finance Xero usage remains separate from operational Xero usage

### Report Validation

- `/finance` loads with current sync and source-summary sections
- `/finance/bookings` matches representative TACBookings booking and payment records
- `/finance/revenue` matches representative finance snapshot periods
- `/finance/costs` matches representative monthly finance snapshot periods
- `/finance/pricing-sensitivity` matches the representative occupancy-assumption inputs used for comparison
- `/finance/cash` matches representative `BANK_BALANCES` snapshots
- `/finance/balance-sheet` matches representative `BALANCE_SHEET` snapshots
- `/finance/working-capital` matches the current-assets and current-liabilities sections of representative `BALANCE_SHEET` snapshots

### Sign-off Evidence

- Record the UAT date, participants, representative comparison periods, and unresolved gaps in the linked GitHub issue or PR
- Do not mark rollout complete while normal finance reporting still depends on the legacy dashboard for any blocker-level path

## Cutover Checklist

### Pre-Cutover

- Confirm every UAT item above is complete
- Record stakeholder sign-off for access, sync health, and report-surface readiness
- Choose the named-user rollout window and communication owner
- Keep the legacy dashboard available as the rollback fallback during rollout

### Cutover

- Grant TACBookings finance access only to the approved named users
- Direct those users to `/finance` as the primary finance workspace
- Watch first-use activity for auth failures, missing data, and route-level errors

### Stabilization

- Monitor at least the next scheduled finance sync after rollout
- Recheck representative report routes after that sync completes
- Capture user-reported mismatches before starting any legacy-dashboard freeze step
- Use the post-cutover monitoring runbook to record first-use results, scheduled-sync evidence, and freeze-readiness decisions

## Rollback Notes

- Trigger rollback if finance access is broken, the latest sync is stale or failed, manager-only boundaries regress, or a blocker-level report mismatch appears
- Pause named-user rollout immediately if any rollback trigger is hit
- Tell affected users to resume the legacy dashboard for normal finance operations until the fix lands
- Remove newly granted finance access only if that is the fastest safe containment path
- Preserve finance snapshots and diagnostics for investigation; do not delete snapshot evidence during rollback
- Do not reopen operational Xero scope unless current implementation evidence proves that boundary caused the failure
- Exit rollback only after the replacement fix lands and targeted UAT is rerun

## Legacy Dashboard Freeze Criteria

- Confirm the post-cutover monitoring runbook is complete and the evidence log is attached to the linked issue or PR
- The UAT checklist is complete with no unresolved blocker that still requires normal legacy-dashboard usage
- Named users are actively using TACBookings finance routes for normal reporting
- At least one scheduled finance sync succeeds after named-user rollout without introducing blocker-level regressions
- Stakeholder sign-off for access, sync, and report parity is recorded
- Rollback notes are communicated before any legacy-dashboard freeze action begins
- Actual legacy-dashboard retirement remains a separate phase `#100` follow-up after these criteria are satisfied
