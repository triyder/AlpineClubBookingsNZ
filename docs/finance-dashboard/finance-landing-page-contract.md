# Finance Landing Page Contract

This document defines the native `/finance` landing page shell added for phase `#97`.

It is intentionally small. The landing page surfaces live finance sync health and TACBookings booking summaries for finance viewers and managers, and it may expose finance-manager Xero connection controls and diagnostics deep links, but it does not implement report pages, charts, or manual sync controls.

## Boundary

- `src/app/(finance)/finance/page.tsx` renders the native finance landing page.
- `src/app/(finance)/finance/layout.tsx` remains the page-level finance viewer guard and shared finance shell.
- `src/lib/finance-landing-page.ts` is the loader and view-model boundary for the landing page.

## Data Sources

- Sync health comes from `src/lib/finance-sync-diagnostics.ts`.
- Booking summary cards come from `src/lib/finance-booking-metrics.ts`.
- Finance-manager connection status comes from `src/lib/finance-xero.ts`.
- Finance access stays gated by `src/lib/finance-auth.ts`.

The landing page must keep those source boundaries explicit in the UI:

- booking summary cards are TACBookings-derived metrics
- sync cards describe finance snapshot freshness and failures

## Default Windows

The landing page uses New Zealand local dates (`Pacific/Auckland`) for its booking summaries.

- realized cards:
  - from the first day of the current NZ-local month
  - through the current NZ-local date inclusive
- forward cards:
  - from the next NZ-local date after today
  - through the next 90 NZ-local dates inclusive
  - `forwardAsOf` is the current NZ-local date

## Viewer and Manager Behavior

- finance viewers and finance managers can load `/finance`
- viewers see the landing page summaries and section links
- managers may see finance Xero connection state plus connect or disconnect controls for the already-landed finance-only OAuth boundary
- manager-only diagnostics links and finance Xero controls must stay hidden from viewers

## Failure Handling

The landing page should degrade by section rather than fail the whole route whenever possible.

- if sync diagnostics fail, the sync section shows an unavailable state
- if booking metrics fail, the realized and forward sections show unavailable states
- one failing boundary must not prevent the other boundary from rendering

## Explicit Non-goals

This landing page does not implement:

- revenue, bookings, cash, or balance sheet report pages
- charts
- manual sync mutations
- booking type schema changes
- operational Xero behavior changes
