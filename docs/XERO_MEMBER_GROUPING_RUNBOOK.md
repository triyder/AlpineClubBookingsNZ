# Xero member grouping — Tokoroa migration & bulk re-sync runbook

This runbook covers the one-time, owner-coordinated cutover for a club that was
already using age-tier Xero contact groups (Tokoroa's live production tenant)
onto the E8 (#1934) member-grouping model, and the general procedure for the
admin-triggered bulk re-sync.

**Nothing here writes to live Xero automatically.** The bulk re-sync is
admin-triggered and dry-run-first. In the E8 wave the live re-sync is **not**
executed — this document is the procedure the owner follows in a later,
scheduled maintenance window.

## Background

- One club-level mode setting — `None`, `Membership Type`, or
  `Membership Type + Age` — controls whether members are auto-grouped in Xero.
- One rule table (`XeroContactGroupRule`): `MANAGED` rules are the group the
  sync adds; `ACCEPTED` rules are tolerated and never removed.
- Each rule targets a **set of age tiers** (`ageTiers`, #2093). Ticking **no
  tiers** means the rule applies to **every** age tier and displays as
  **"All age tiers"** — this is the old null "Any age" wildcard, so existing
  rules migrate with zero behaviour change (`ageTier = X` → `[X]`, `null` → `[]`).
  A rule can now target any subset, e.g. Youth + Child in one rule. Tier sets are
  stored canonical-sorted, and ticking every tier collapses to the "all tiers"
  empty set so there is exactly one canonical shape.
- **Overlap resolution — most specific wins (D-B4).** The ladder is
  `type + tiers` > `type-only` > `tiers-only` > `neither`. Among tier-bearing
  rules on the same rung, **fewer tiers is more specific** (a rule naming just
  `ADULT` beats one naming `ADULT, YOUTH`). An **"all age tiers" (`[]`) rule is
  the LEAST specific** in the tier dimension — a rule naming any specific tier
  always beats it. Exact ties break deterministically by `sortOrder` then group id.
- The E8 migration backfills existing age-tier group config into **tier-only
  rules** and sets the mode to `Membership Type + Age` when any age-tier group
  config existed, else `None`. Tier-only rules resolve identically to the
  retired age-only sync, so a correctly-grouped member produces **zero diff**.
- The system **never deletes a Xero contact group** and never removes a member
  from a group that no active rule references.

## Pre-checks (do these first, read-only)

1. **Refresh the Xero group cache.** On the **Xero member grouping** surface,
   click **"Refresh from Xero"** (top-right) — the lightweight action that
   re-pulls the contact-group cache (the same full refresh as the members-list
   "Refresh Xero Groups" button). The **"Last synced"** header shows when the
   cache was last refreshed; confirm it now reads a recent time. The dry-run
   recomputes from this cache, so a stale cache gives a misleading diff. **This
   refresh is mandatory:** until a `CONTACT_GROUP_FULL_REFRESH` has run at least
   once there is no cursor to anchor dry-run freshness to, so the dry-run returns
   **no `dryRunId`** and a bulk re-sync is impossible — the pre-check refresh is
   what first unlocks the re-sync. (Because "Refresh from Xero" moves the
   `CONTACT_GROUP_FULL_REFRESH` cursor, running it also **invalidates any prior
   dry-run**; re-run the dry-run after refreshing.)
2. **Verify the migration produced the expected rules.** On the **Xero member
   grouping** admin surface, confirm:
   - the mode is **Membership Type + Age**;
   - there is one **MANAGED tier-only** rule per age tier that previously had a
     primary Xero group, pointing at the same group;
   - one **ACCEPTED tier-only** rule per previously-accepted group;
   - **no other rule is active.** The migration deactivates every pre-existing
     `XeroContactGroupRule` row (written by the retired membership-types
     editor and never read by the live sync) so nothing but the tier-only
     backfill goes live at deploy. Deactivated legacy rules stay visible on
     the surface and can be re-enabled deliberately via the new UI — but only
     after this dry-run cutover has been reviewed.
3. **Run the dry-run diff.** It must show **≈ zero add/remove** for an install
   whose members were already correctly grouped. Investigate any non-zero diff
   before proceeding — the expected residue is only members who were genuinely
   mis-grouped in Xero before the cutover, plus the **information-only**
   section: members no rule matches (e.g. `NOT_APPLICABLE`
   organisations/schools) still sitting in managed groups. Those are surfaced
   with the group(s) they sit in but are **never written to** by any sync or
   bulk run — clean them up manually in Xero if desired.

## Cutover (scheduled window, owner-run)

4. **Owner review.** The owner reviews the dry-run diff (counts, per-member
   add/remove, the estimated Xero call budget, and the list of members skipped
   because they have no Xero contact). No member without a Xero contact is
   silently omitted.
   - **Truncated per-member list.** The UI renders at most `limit` (default 500)
     mismatch rows, but the **digest and headline counts gate the full set** — a
     re-sync processes every mismatch, not just the shown rows. If the dry-run
     reports **more than 500 mismatches**, raise the dry-run `limit` (up to 1000)
     to review them all before approving, rather than reviewing only the first
     page.
5. **Schedule a window.** Xero limits are ~60 calls/minute and ~5,000/day; the
   re-sync is chunked, resumable, and backs off on 429s. Size the window from
   the dry-run's call-budget estimate.
6. **Run the bulk re-sync.** Admin-triggered from the grouping surface. It is
   cache-first pre-filtered (only mismatched members are touched), processes in
   chunks, and resumes from a member-id cursor. Per-member failures are ledgered
   (in `XeroSyncOperation`) and non-fatal; a daily-limit halt leaves a resume
   cursor to continue the next day. The job never advances the CONTACT
   delta-sync watermark.
   - **Server-enforced dry-run freshness (#1961).** Each dry-run persists its
     provenance (a `XeroMemberGroupingDryRun` row: the mode, the
     `CONTACT_GROUP_FULL_REFRESH` cache cursor it was computed against, a
     fingerprint of the active rules, and a digest of the planned changes). The
     bulk re-sync must reference that dry-run id, and the **server** re-validates
     freshness at execution start — it is not a client-asserted flag. A run is
     rejected (with a message telling you to re-run the dry-run) when the
     referenced dry-run is **absent** (HTTP 422), or when — HTTP 409 — it is
     **older than the 30-minute window** (initiating run only), the **group
     cache was refreshed** since it ran (its recorded cursor no longer matches),
     the **mode or a rule changed** since it ran, or (initiating run only) the
     **planned changes drifted** from the reviewed diff. So if you refresh the
     Xero group cache, or edit the mode/rules, after previewing, you must re-run
     the dry-run before the re-sync will proceed. Resume chunks skip the
     wall-clock/plan-drift checks (a daily-limit resume may span days) but still
     enforce the cache-cursor and rules equality, so a rule or cache change
     mid-run aborts every subsequent chunk. Both the accepted run and each
     rejection are audit-logged (`XERO_GROUPING_BULK_RESYNC` /
     `XERO_GROUPING_BULK_RESYNC_REJECTED`) with the dry-run id.
   - **Started/resume semantics (#1961).** Whether a request initiates or resumes
     is decided by the **server**, not the caller. Initiating a re-sync
     atomically stamps the dry-run row as started; a resume is accepted **only**
     against a dry-run that was already started (HTTP 409 `not_started`
     otherwise — a resume cursor cannot be forged onto a never-started dry-run to
     skip the initiating freshness checks). Initiating twice from the **same**
     dry-run is rejected (HTTP 409 `already_started`); the normal flow initiates
     once and then uses **Resume re-sync** for every following chunk, so this only
     trips on a genuine double-start — re-run the dry-run to start over.
7. **Post-check.** Re-refresh the group cache and re-run the dry-run — it should
   now report an **empty** add/remove diff (the information-only section may
   still list `NOT_APPLICABLE` members you choose to leave parked in managed
   groups). Spot-check a few contacts in Xero.
8. **Optional manual cleanup.** Any Xero group the club no longer wants is
   removed **by the owner directly in Xero** — the system never deletes a Xero
   group. Members left in a now-unreferenced group are not touched by the
   system; remove them in Xero manually if desired.

## Member import — mapping modes (#2108)

`/admin/xero` → **Setup Tools** → **Import Members from Xero** creates local
members from cached Xero contact groups. Each group is mapped in one of three
modes (choose with the **Map groups to** selector):

- **Age tiers** (default, unchanged behaviour) — map each group to a bookable
  age tier (Infant/Child/Youth/Adult). No membership type is written.
- **Membership types** — map each group to an active membership type. The
  member's age tier is derived: an age-exempt **FORCED** type (its only allowed
  tier is N/A) forces `NOT_APPLICABLE`; otherwise the tier comes from the Xero
  date-of-birth, falling back to `ADULT`.
- **Membership types + age tiers** — map each group to a type AND a bookable
  tier. A FORCED type still derives N/A (the tier select is hidden and the row
  shows a "members will be age-exempt (N/A)" hint); otherwise the picked tier is
  written and the type is assigned.

Rules and guarantees:

- The API never accepts an explicit `NOT_APPLICABLE` tier — N/A is only ever
  derived from an age-exempt type.
- A type mapping requires **membership edit** access in addition to the finance
  access the import already needs; a finance-only admin is rejected.
- All selected types must exist and be **active**, or the whole import is
  rejected (nothing is written) with the offending type(s) listed.
- Assignments are written for the **current season** with source `IMPORT` and
  the contact group name as the source detail.
- **The import never overwrites an existing assignment.** A matched-existing
  member who already holds a current-season assignment is left untouched and
  reported in the result. To change such a member's type, use the bulk-assign /
  membership tooling — not a re-import.
- Newly-created members get their assignment in a batch; matched-existing
  members without an assignment go through the hardened save path, so an
  age-exempt type correctly flips them to N/A (and sweeps any future
  shared-double placements) with a per-member audit record.
- A contact that appears in two mapped groups is imported once — the first
  mapped group in the list wins, and the dropped duplicate is reported.
- If two **different** contacts link to the **same** local member with
  conflicting type mappings, the first mapping wins and the loser is reported as
  a member collision (never silently applied).
- The results panel surfaces the assignment count, any kept-existing assignments
  (with the member and both membership-type names, and a bulk-tool remediation
  hint for a different-type keep), dropped duplicate contacts, and member
  collisions — each list bounded with a "+N more" overflow.
- The import writes one summary audit row and does **not** synchronously resync
  Xero contact groups; imported members reconcile through the periodic/mismatch
  tooling described above.

## Notes & guardrails

- **Mode/rule changes never auto-resync.** Switching the mode, or adding,
  editing, deactivating, or deleting a rule, does not re-group anyone
  immediately. Members re-group on their next trigger (age-tier change,
  current-season membership-type change, cron age-up) or via this bulk action.
  A mode/rule change also **invalidates any prior dry-run** for the bulk
  re-sync: the server's freshness check (#1961) rejects a re-sync whose
  referenced dry-run predates the change, so re-run the dry-run after editing.
- **Deleting a rule does not remove members** already in that group — it only
  shrinks the managed universe. The admin UI states this at the point of
  deletion.
- **Multi-tier rules and dry-run freshness (#2093).** Widening or narrowing a
  rule's tier set changes the grouping fingerprint the freshness check compares,
  so it invalidates any prior dry-run exactly like any other rule edit. The
  fingerprint is back-compatible for the migrated shapes: a migrated `[]`
  ("all tiers") rule and a migrated single-tier `[X]` rule fingerprint
  **identically** to the old null / scalar values, so the **first post-deploy
  resync sees no spurious churn** — only genuinely new 2+-tier rules move it.
- **`None` mode is a total no-op.** Selecting `None` leaves every existing Xero
  group membership untouched and stops all managed adds/removes, including on
  the membership-cancellation path.
- The legacy `AgeTierXeroAcceptedContactGroup` table was **dropped** by the E13
  contract migration `20260720120000` (#1939) — no deployed code queried or
  joined it after E8. The `AgeTierSetting.xeroContactGroupId/Name` columns are
  still **present, and become drop-eligible only once the #2130 runtime-prep
  release has itself deployed**. E13 deferred them because the deployed runtime
  still SELECTed them; the #2130 runtime-prep release (CHANGELOG `Unreleased`,
  the release that follows `v0.12.2`) closed that gap in two steps — first
  narrowing the reads (`getAgeTierSettings`), then the writes (the age-tier
  settings route, setup wizard, config self-heal and seed upserts), since Prisma
  emits an implicit `RETURNING` over every scalar column of an unnarrowed
  `create`/`update`/`upsert`. **Do not drop the columns in the same release as
  that runtime-prep.** Until the runtime-prep release is itself the
  deployed/draining colour in production, the live `v0.12.2` colour still names
  these columns in SQL, so the follow-up contract migration is only safe in a
  *later* release, once the runtime-prep release has shipped and soaked.
