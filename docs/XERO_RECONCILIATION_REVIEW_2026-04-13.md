# Xero Reconciliation Review

## Scope

This review focuses on how TACBookings should reconcile booking and membership data with Xero, with an emphasis on:

- durable auditability of data pushed to and pulled from Xero
- deep links back to Xero objects
- failure visibility
- safe retry and re-push workflows

## Implementation Status (2026-04-13)

The review below started as a design and gap-analysis document. The codebase now has the reconciliation foundation, outbound operation ledgering, admin inspection, and a first synchronous retry path for supported failed operations. The remaining work is mostly around background execution, broader replay coverage, inbound reconcile jobs, and reporting/hardening.

### Delivered to date

- added durable reconciliation tables in `prisma/schema.prisma`:
  - `XeroSyncOperation`
  - `XeroObjectLink`
  - `XeroInboundEvent`
- added migration `prisma/migrations/20260413210000_add_xero_reconciliation_foundation/`
- added shared helpers:
  - `src/lib/xero-sync.ts` for operation logging, object-link persistence, inbound-event persistence, and deterministic idempotency helpers
  - `src/lib/xero-links.ts` for centralized Xero deep-link generation
- instrumented outbound Xero write paths in `src/lib/xero.ts` to:
  - generate deterministic idempotency keys
  - use `withXeroRetry()` on write calls as well as reads
  - persist request and response payloads
  - record `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`, and `PARTIAL` outcomes
  - persist reusable `XeroObjectLink` rows for created or linked objects
- covered these business flows in the ledger:
  - member contact create and update
  - booking invoice creation
  - refund credit note creation
  - unapplied credit note creation for account credit
  - credit note allocations
  - supplementary invoices for booking modifications
  - modification credit notes for booking reductions
  - entrance fee invoices
  - membership subscription refresh / fetch
- updated modification routes so Xero artifacts can be tied to the specific `BookingModification` row, not only the parent booking
- updated manual member link / unlink routes to maintain `XeroObjectLink`
- updated `src/app/api/webhooks/xero/route.ts` to persist inbound webhook payloads into `XeroInboundEvent`
- added an admin operations endpoint and UI surface:
  - `src/app/api/admin/xero/operations/route.ts`
  - operations section on `src/app/(admin)/admin/xero/page.tsx`
- added synchronous admin retry support for supported failed operations:
  - `src/lib/xero-operation-retry.ts`
  - `src/app/api/admin/xero/operations/[id]/retry/route.ts`
  - retry controls in `src/app/(admin)/admin/xero/page.tsx`

### Verified to date

- `npm run build`
- `npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/xero.test.ts src/lib/__tests__/xero-member-management.test.ts src/lib/__tests__/phase8c-integrations.test.ts src/lib/__tests__/phone-address-sync.test.ts src/lib/__tests__/phase3b-member-detail-edit.test.ts`
- `npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/xero-operation-retry.test.ts`

### Not yet implemented

The following recommendations from this review are still open:

- queue-backed requeue / worker retry for failed `XeroSyncOperation` rows
- repair flows for `PARTIAL` operations
- record-specific Xero operations surfaces on booking, payment, and member detail screens
- webhook-driven targeted reconcile jobs that apply inbound changes to business state
- Xero-specific event claim/dedupe processing tied to `ProcessedWebhookEvent`
- incremental pull jobs using `If-Modified-Since`
- repeated-failure alerting by correlation key
- nightly reconciliation reports / alerting
- historical backfill of old canonical Xero IDs into the new ledger/link tables
- optional Xero history notes / attachments for high-value financial objects

So the current state is:

- observability foundation: implemented
- deterministic outbound write tracking: implemented
- admin inspection of recent operations: implemented
- synchronous retry for supported failed outbound operations: implemented
- queue-backed replay, partial repair, and background execution: pending
- inbound business-state reconciliation: pending
- reporting, alerting, and historical backfill: pending

## Current State

The codebase already has a solid base:

- encrypted Xero OAuth token storage in `prisma/schema.prisma` (`XeroToken`)
- Xero rate-limit handling for many read paths in `src/lib/xero.ts` via `withXeroRetry()`
- generic local audit logging in `prisma/schema.prisma` (`AuditLog`) and `src/lib/audit.ts`
- webhook delivery monitoring in `prisma/schema.prisma` (`WebhookLog`) and `src/lib/webhook-log.ts`
- canonical Xero links stored for some objects:
  - member contact link via `Member.xeroContactId`
  - booking invoice link via `Payment.xeroInvoiceId` and `xeroInvoiceNumber`
  - subscription invoice link via `MemberSubscription.xeroInvoiceId`, `xeroInvoiceNumber`, `xeroOnlineInvoiceUrl`

There is also some manual remediation already:

- admins can generate a missing booking invoice through `src/app/api/admin/payments/[id]/generate-invoice/route.ts`
- admins can manually push and link contacts through the member admin UI and Xero routes

## Current Remaining Gaps

### 1. No queue-backed replay or outbox execution model yet

Outbound writes are now logged durably and supported `FAILED` operations can be retried synchronously from the admin UI. What is still missing is the more robust execution model originally proposed:

- create `PENDING` operations first, then execute them from a worker
- requeue failed operations without requiring an inline admin request
- recover automatically from crashes or network timeouts after local state is committed
- treat retry and replay as a first-class background workflow rather than a synchronous button action

### 2. `PARTIAL` operations still need dedicated repair workflows

The current retry helper intentionally supports only deterministic `FAILED` outbound operations. It does not yet repair partially completed flows such as:

- invoice created but Xero payment creation failed afterward
- credit note created but allocation or refund payment creation failed afterward
- modification credit note created but allocation failed afterward

Those need targeted follow-up actions that understand the already-created Xero artifact instead of simply replaying the whole original call.

### 3. Inbound Xero activity is persisted but not reconciled into business state

`src/app/api/webhooks/xero/route.ts` now persists webhook payloads into `XeroInboundEvent`, but the inbound side is still observability-first rather than reconciliation-first. The missing pieces are:

- claim/dedupe processing tied to `ProcessedWebhookEvent`
- targeted reconcile jobs triggered from stored inbound events
- applying inbound invoice/contact changes back to TACBookings business state
- incremental pull jobs using `If-Modified-Since`

### 4. Operational surfaces are still centralized and limited

The admin Xero screen now shows recent operations and supports retry for some failures, but operators still cannot see the same reconciliation context directly on the main record screens:

- booking detail pages do not show related Xero operations and links
- payment screens do not show the full Xero operation history for a payment
- member detail screens do not show recent contact/subscription sync operations
- there is no record-scoped drill-down view that groups operations, links, and errors for a single TACBookings record

### 5. Reporting, alerting, and historical cleanup are still open

The hardening layer from the original review remains outstanding:

- repeated-failure alerting by correlation key
- nightly reconciliation reports for missing links or drift
- historical backfill of pre-ledger Xero IDs into `XeroObjectLink` / `XeroSyncOperation`
- optional Xero history notes or attachments where they materially improve supportability

## Recommended Design

## A. Add a dedicated Xero sync operations table

Best practice here is to introduce a durable per-operation ledger, for example `XeroSyncOperation`.

Suggested shape:

- `id`
- `direction`: `OUTBOUND` | `INBOUND`
- `entityType`: `CONTACT` | `INVOICE` | `PAYMENT` | `CREDIT_NOTE` | `ALLOCATION` | `SUBSCRIPTION`
- `operationType`: `CREATE` | `UPDATE` | `ALLOCATE` | `FETCH` | `WEBHOOK_RECONCILE`
- `localModel`: `Member` | `Booking` | `Payment` | `MemberSubscription` | `BookingModification`
- `localId`
- `status`: `PENDING` | `RUNNING` | `SUCCEEDED` | `FAILED` | `PARTIAL` | `CANCELLED`
- `idempotencyKey`
- `correlationKey`
- `attemptCount`
- `replayable`
- `lastErrorCode`
- `lastErrorMessage`
- `requestPayload` (JSON)
- `responsePayload` (JSON)
- `xeroObjectType`
- `xeroObjectId`
- `xeroObjectNumber`
- `xeroObjectUrl`
- `createdByMemberId` (nullable)
- `startedAt`
- `completedAt`
- `createdAt`
- `updatedAt`

This should become the audit trail for every Xero push and every meaningful Xero pull/webhook reconciliation.

## B. Keep canonical link fields, but add a reusable object-link table

The current `Member.xeroContactId`, `Payment.xeroInvoiceId`, and `MemberSubscription.xeroInvoiceId` fields are still useful as fast canonical pointers.

But for reconciliation and replay, add a normalized table such as `XeroObjectLink` so the system can store multiple related Xero objects per local record:

- one booking payment may have:
  - an invoice
  - one or more Xero payments
  - one or more credit notes
  - one or more allocations
- one booking modification may create:
  - a supplementary invoice
  - a modification credit note

Suggested fields:

- `localModel`
- `localId`
- `xeroObjectType`
- `xeroObjectId`
- `xeroObjectNumber`
- `xeroObjectUrl`
- `role` such as `PRIMARY_INVOICE`, `REFUND_CREDIT_NOTE`, `SUPPLEMENTARY_INVOICE`, `ALLOCATION`, `CONTACT`
- `active`

## C. Move outbound Xero writes behind an outbox-style service

For anything financially important, prefer this flow:

1. Complete the local database transaction first.
2. Insert a `XeroSyncOperation` row in `PENDING`.
3. Let a worker execute the Xero call.
4. Persist returned Xero IDs and links.
5. Mark the operation `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`.

This prevents request/response timing issues from becoming silent data drift and gives you a safe place to retry from.

For user-triggered actions where you still want an inline response, you can execute immediately but still write the same `XeroSyncOperation` row before and after the call.

## D. Use deterministic idempotency keys on every Xero write

Every outbound create/update/allocation call should have a deterministic idempotency key derived from the local action, for example:

- `booking:{bookingId}:invoice:v1`
- `payment:{paymentId}:refund-credit-note:{refundAmountCents}:v1`
- `booking-mod:{modificationId}:supplementary-invoice:v1`
- `member:{memberId}:contact:create:v1`

The key should be stored on `XeroSyncOperation` and reused for retries. That makes replay safe when the original write reached Xero but the local process failed afterward.

## E. Store raw inbound payloads and reconcile asynchronously

For Xero webhooks and incremental pull jobs:

- store the raw payload on a dedicated inbound events table such as `XeroInboundEvent`
- claim and dedupe by event ID or a derived correlation key
- enqueue reconciliation work from that stored event
- update the event row to `processed` / `failed`

This keeps inbound handling inspectable and replayable, and avoids losing the event context after the request completes.

## F. Add an admin Xero operations view

The admin Xero screen should gain an operations tab that supports:

- filtering by status: `FAILED`, `RUNNING`, `PENDING`, `SUCCEEDED`
- filtering by object type: contact, invoice, payment, credit note, allocation
- viewing local record, request payload, response payload, error, attempts
- deep links to the Xero object when present
- `Retry` / `Requeue` for replayable failures
- `Open local record` and `Open Xero object`

That is the operational UI the system is currently missing.

## G. Add Xero history notes and attachments selectively

Where helpful, write a lightweight history note into Xero and attach a document when it materially improves auditability.

Examples:

- invoice history note: `Created by TACBookings for booking abc12345`
- credit note history note: `Refund created from TACBookings payment pmt_123`
- attach booking summary PDF or exported receipt only when it solves a real support problem

This should complement the TACBookings sync ledger, not replace it.

## What To Persist Per Business Flow

### Booking invoice creation

Persist:

- Xero invoice ID
- Xero invoice number
- online invoice URL if available
- Xero payment ID for the recorded Stripe settlement
- operation log row

### Refund / credit note

Persist:

- Xero credit note ID
- Xero allocation outcome
- Xero refund payment ID if created
- operation log row

### Booking modification

Persist:

- supplementary invoice ID when price increases
- modification credit note ID when price decreases
- any associated payment/allocation IDs
- operation log row tied to the specific `BookingModification`

### Membership subscription refresh

Persist:

- the invoice checked
- the pull timestamp
- the comparison result
- the local status before and after
- operation log row per member refresh

## Repo-Specific Phase Plan

## Phase 1: Observability foundation

- add `XeroSyncOperation`
- add centralized Xero URL builder helper
- start logging all existing create/update calls into the new table
- add deep links for all already-known Xero IDs

Status: implemented in this pass.

## Phase 2: Safe outbound writes

- add deterministic idempotency keys to all Xero write calls in `src/lib/xero.ts`
- persist supplementary invoice and modification credit note links
- capture response payloads and error payloads

Status: implemented for the main existing Xero write flows in `src/lib/xero.ts`.

## Phase 3: Replay and manual repair

- add admin Xero operations UI
- add retry / requeue endpoints
- make booking/payment/member detail screens show related Xero operations

Status: partially implemented.

- admin operations API and UI were added to the Xero admin screen
- synchronous retry support for supported failed operations is implemented
- queue-backed requeue and partial-operation repair are still pending
- record-specific surfaces for booking/payment/member detail pages are still pending

## Phase 4: Inbound reconciliation

- add `XeroInboundEvent`
- persist webhook payloads
- use webhooks plus targeted pull/reconcile jobs
- apply `If-Modified-Since` for incremental pull jobs

Status: partially implemented.

- `XeroInboundEvent` and webhook payload persistence were added
- targeted reconcile jobs and incremental pull work are still pending

## Phase 5: Hardening

- move high-value Xero writes to a background worker/outbox flow
- add alerting for repeated failures on the same correlation key
- add nightly reconciliation reports for missing local-to-Xero links

Status: not yet implemented.

## Best-Practice Notes

- Do not rely on a generic audit log for accounting reconciliation. Financial integrations need a purpose-built sync ledger.
- Do not rely on UI-only manual repair. Persist enough metadata so retries can be deterministic and safe.
- Keep canonical foreign keys for the "main" Xero object, but use a normalized link table for one-to-many Xero artifacts.
- Make every outbound write idempotent and every inbound event replayable.
- Prefer incremental pull plus webhook-triggered reconciliation over full rescans whenever possible.
- Capture links to Xero objects at creation time so support staff can jump directly from TACBookings into Xero.
