# Playwright E2E Suite

Browser end-to-end tests for the **Critical** journeys in
[`END_TO_END_TEST_MATRIX.md`](END_TO_END_TEST_MATRIX.md), driven against the
staging Docker Compose stack (`docker-compose.staging.yml`, compose project
`tacbookings-staging`) seeded with the base seed (`prisma/seed.ts`) followed by
the demo seed (`prisma/demo-seed.ts`).

## What is covered

| Spec | Matrix row | Journey |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `e2e/two-factor-login.spec.ts` | Global two-factor enforcement (Critical) | Forced TOTP enrollment on first login, recovery codes, protected-route gating for unverified sessions, wrong-code rejection, TOTP re-login, single-use recovery codes |
| `e2e/booking.spec.ts` | Create booking with capacity lock (Critical) | Member books a bed through `/book` (confirm-details gate → dates → guests → review → payment step); while payment is owed the booking holds **no** bed (issue #737 — only committed money reserves capacity); the same member cannot hold the same lodge night twice |
| `e2e/stripe-payment.spec.ts` | Stripe payment success/failure (Critical) | In-wizard step-4 card payment with Stripe test cards: `4242…` confirms the booking and the paid booking occupies its beds; `4000 0000 0000 0002` declines and leaves it payable. **Skips unless genuine Stripe test-mode keys are configured** |
| `e2e/admin-roles.spec.ts` | Role boundaries (High) | One persona per bundled access role (ADMIN_READONLY, ADMIN_BOOKINGS, ADMIN_MEMBERSHIP, ADMIN_CONTENT, FINANCE_USER, FINANCE_ADMIN, LODGE). Each asserts an in-area page renders and an out-of-area page is blocked (redirect), per the authoritative matrix in `src/lib/admin-permissions.ts` and the `/finance` (finance-auth) and `/lodge` (kiosk) gates |
| `e2e/waitlist.spec.ts` | Waitlist / force-confirm / offer (High) | Member is refused a seeded-full night and joins the waitlist (WAITLISTED); admin force-confirms it off the waitlist (overbook branch) through `/admin/waitlist`; member accepts a seeded, non-expired offer through the offer card; the admin waitlist surfaces offer + expiry state |
| `e2e/internet-banking.spec.ts` | Internet Banking settlement (Critical) | With Xero **absent**, a card PAYMENT_PENDING booking is switched to Internet Banking; the detail page shows the Internet Banking card with a `BOOKING-…` reference and does not crash (the Xero invoice is queued but never sent while disconnected). Toggles the Xero + Internet Banking modules on for its run and restores them |
| `e2e/membership-application.spec.ts` | Membership application (High) | Public application submit; both nominators agree through the real `/nominations/<token>` pages; admin approves; the applicant then exists as a member |

Not covered by browser tests (by design):

- **Email-code two-factor enrollment** — needs an SMTP capture container; TOTP is
  covered, email-code is a manual browser check.
- **Waitlist offer creation + expiry** — run only by the in-process scheduler
  (`src/lib/cron-waitlist.ts` via `instrumentation.node.ts`); `CRON_ENABLED` is
  off in staging and there is **no** HTTP waitlist-cron endpoint, so these are not
  browser-reachable. The offer/expiry *state* is asserted via the admin UI on the
  seeded (expired) offer; the transitions themselves are unit-tested
  (`src/lib/__tests__/waitlist.test.ts`).
- **Webhook signature classes** (Stripe/Xero/SES valid/duplicate/malformed/
  oversized/wrong-signature) — covered by targeted route tests (issue #1133), not
  browser flows.
- **The email delivery of nomination links** — email is unconfigured on staging;
  the membership spec drives the confirmation pages using seeded tokens instead
  (see below).

## Running locally

```bash
cp .env.staging.example .env.staging   # once; adjust ports if taken
npm run test:e2e                       # prepare stack + run suite
```

`npm run test:e2e` (via `scripts/e2e-stack.sh`) does the following:

1. Starts the staging compose Postgres (host port `STAGING_POSTGRES_PORT`,
   default 5433 — **never** the production 5432).
2. Drops and recreates the `public` schema, then runs `prisma migrate deploy`,
   the base seed, and the demo seed, so every run starts from a known state.
   It then enables the modules the E2E journeys need
   (`e2e/setup/enable-e2e-modules.ts`) — a fresh database defaults these off:
   `twoFactor` (two-factor enforcement), `waitlist` (`/admin/waitlist`,
   force-confirm, waitlist-confirm), `kiosk` + `chores` (`/lodge/*` and the
   roster, for the LODGE role boundary), `financeDashboard` (`/finance`, for
   the finance role boundaries), and `bedAllocation` (`/admin/bed-allocation`,
   `/admin/rooms-beds`, for the bed-allocation board). `internetBankingPayments`
   and `xeroIntegration` stay off; the internet-banking spec toggles them on for
   its own run (via
   `PUT /api/admin/modules`) and restores them, so the rest of the suite keeps
   the default card-payment flow.
3. Builds (unless `E2E_SKIP_APP_BUILD=1`) and starts the staging app on
   `STAGING_HTTP_PORT` (default 3001), waiting for `/api/health/ready`.
4. Runs `playwright test` with `E2E_BASE_URL` pointed at the staging app.

Other entry points:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:prepare   # stack + fresh database only
npm run test:e2e:run       # suite only (stack already prepared)
npm run test:e2e:run -- --ui               # Playwright UI mode
npm run test:e2e:run -- e2e/booking.spec.ts # one spec
npm run test:e2e:down      # stop the stack and delete its volumes
```

First-time setup: `npx playwright install chromium` (CI uses `--with-deps`).
The HTML report lands in `playwright-report/`; traces and screenshots for
failures land in `test-results/`.

The suite is serial (one worker) on purpose: specs assert on lodge capacity
and share seeded personas, so they must not interleave.

## Environment

Configuration comes from `.env.staging` (override the path with
`E2E_ENV_FILE`). Keep placeholder provider keys — the suite never needs live
providers, and `scripts/e2e-stack.sh` refuses to run if it sees `sk_live`/
`pk_live` Stripe keys.

- `E2E_BASE_URL` — target app (default `http://localhost:$STAGING_HTTP_PORT`).
- `E2E_DEMO_PASSWORD` — only if the demo seed ran with a custom
  `DEMO_SEED_PASSWORD`.
- Personas: the suite signs in as `alice@demo.alpineclub.test` (PAID
  subscription; books and pays) and `bob@demo.alpineclub.test` (drives
  two-factor enrollment). TOTP secrets and recovery codes captured during
  enrollment are stored under `e2e/.auth/` (gitignored) and cleared at the
  start of each run.
- Stay dates are computed relative to today (Monday–Wednesday windows at least
  three weeks out). The base seed's seasons cover Jun–Sep 2026 and Nov
  2026–Mar 2027; a run whose windows fall in a season gap fails loudly at the
  season assertion — extend the seeded seasons if that happens.

## Seeded fixtures and personas

The demo seed (`prisma/demo-seed.ts`) writes deterministic E2E fixtures behind
its localhost-only guard, shared with the specs through
`e2e/helpers/fixtures.ts` so seed data and assertions never drift:

- **Scoped-role personas** — one member per bundled access role
  (`readonly-admin@`, `booking-officer@`, `membership-officer@`,
  `content-manager@`, `finance-viewer@`, `treasurer@`, `lodge-user@`
  `demo.alpineclub.test`), each seeded with a single `MemberAccessRole` row via
  `ensureMemberAccessRoles`. `admin-roles.spec.ts` derives its expectations
  straight from `src/lib/admin-permissions.ts`, not hand-written rules.
- **`e2e-admin@demo.alpineclub.test`** — a full ADMIN with the demo password.
  The base seed admin forces a password change and uses an unknown password, so
  it cannot drive logins; this persona approves applications and toggles modules.
- **Waitlist fixtures** — a September window filled to capacity (lodge capacity
  is 20, from `config/club.example.json`) so a fresh booking there is refused,
  plus a ready-to-accept `WAITLIST_OFFERED` booking. Both are owned by
  **`wanda-waitlist@demo.alpineclub.test`**, a member seeded PAID with a
  **complete, self-confirmed profile** so she can create a booking through the
  API without the member-details gate. (alice is intentionally left with an
  unconfirmed profile so `booking.spec.ts` keeps exercising that gate, #1124.)
- **Internet-banking fixture** — a card (Stripe) `PAYMENT_PENDING` booking owned
  by the complete-profile `wanda-waitlist@` member, far enough out to clear the
  internet-banking lead-time cutoff.
- **Membership application** — a `PENDING_NOMINATORS` application whose two
  nomination tokens have **known raw values**. `src/lib/action-tokens` hashes
  tokens with a plain SHA-256 (no secret), so the seed stores
  `sha256(<known token>)` and the spec drives `/nominations/<token>` directly —
  the email that would normally carry the link is unconfigured on staging. Both
  seeded nominators (`wanda-waitlist@`, `nadia@`) have complete, confirmed
  profiles so the onboarding modal never blocks their nomination pages.

Because these fixtures (and the two-factor enrollment) mutate seeded state, the
suite is designed to run against a **fresh** prepare each time; re-running
`test:e2e:run` without a preceding `test:e2e:prepare` is not supported.

## Browser system dependencies

Playwright's Chromium needs the usual Linux browser libraries. On a host that
is missing one (commonly `libasound.so.2`, which surfaces as
`error while loading shared libraries: libasound.so.2`), install them with
`npx playwright install-deps chromium` (needs root), or, without root, extract
the package and point the loader at it:

```bash
apt-get download libasound2t64 && dpkg -x libasound2t64*.deb extracted
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PWD/extracted/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" \
  npm run test:e2e:run
```

CI installs the deps with `npx playwright install --with-deps`.

## Enabling the Stripe payment specs

The Payment Element requires a genuine Stripe **test-mode** account; the
payment specs skip (loudly) when the keys look like placeholders and refuse to
run at all against `sk_live`/`pk_live` keys (both `scripts/e2e-stack.sh` and
`e2e/helpers/stripe.ts` guard this).

Two env vars carry the keys, and they flow into the stack differently:

| Var | Kind | How it flows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (`pk_test_…`) | Build arg | `docker-compose.yml` passes it as a Docker build `arg`; Next.js **inlines** it at build time, so the app image must be **rebuilt** when it changes. |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (`sk_test_…`) | Runtime env | Passed to the `app` container at runtime; picked up on restart, no rebuild needed. |

- **Locally**: put both real test-mode keys in `.env.staging`, then run
  `npm run test:e2e` (not `test:e2e:prepare` with `E2E_SKIP_APP_BUILD=1`) so the
  app image is rebuilt with the new publishable key. `e2e-stack.sh` parses
  `.env.staging` and exports both vars, so the Playwright process also sees them
  and stops skipping.
- **CI**: provide `STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_TEST_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
  repository secrets; `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` maps them onto the two vars
  above. The workflow refuses live keys. **Never commit real keys anywhere.**

## CI

`.github/workflows/e2e.yml` runs the suite on PRs and pushes to `main`. It is
**non-blocking** (`continue-on-error: true`) while the suite beds in — a red
E2E job does not fail the workflow. Check the job log and the uploaded
`playwright-report` artifact when it goes red. Promote it to a required gate
by removing `continue-on-error` once it has proven stable.

## Safety

- The stack is the isolated `tacbookings-staging` compose project with its own
  Postgres volume. The scripts never touch port 5432 or the production compose
  project.
- No live providers: Stripe stays in test mode, email/SES stays unconfigured
  (failed sends are recorded by the app's email outbox, which is expected on
  staging), Xero and cron stay disabled.
