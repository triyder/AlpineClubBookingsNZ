# Managing your family & household

Audience: Member

## What it is

How you group your household so you can book and be billed together, and how you
record a partner. You manage all of it from your **Profile** — the **Family
Group** and **Partner** sections (`/profile`). Family changes go to the club for
review before they take effect. The lifecycle is in
[`STATE_MACHINES.md`](../STATE_MACHINES.md#family-and-dependent-lifecycle).

## When you'd use it

- You want your partner, or your children, on the same family group as you.
- You are joining an existing family group, or starting a new one.
- You want to add an infant, child, or youth who does not have their own login.
- You want to record a partner (husband/wife/partner) relationship with the club.

## Step-by-step

### Family group — join, create, or add dependents

Open **Profile** and find the **Family Group** section.

- If you are **not** in a family group, you can:
  - **Request to Join a Family Group** — by another member's email. They (or the
    club) approve you into their group.
  - **Create a Family Group** — from scratch. You can give it an optional name
    (it defaults to "*{your last name}* Family"), name an optional **partner by
    email**, and add optional **infant / child / youth** rows in one go. The
    whole bundle goes to the club for review before the group exists.
- Adults in a group can invite other adults and request to add infants,
  children, or youth. **Login-capable adults** confirm their own inclusion;
  **dependents** (infants/children/youth) do not have their own login and are
  managed by the group's adults.

While a create-group request is pending, the Join/Create buttons are replaced by
"Your family group request is awaiting admin review", showing the requested group
name, partner, and children you submitted.

### Partner — record a relationship

In the **Partner** section you can record one partner (husband, wife, or
partner):

1. Enter your **partner's email address** and click **Send partner request**.
   They must be a registered adult member with a login; they confirm the
   relationship from **their own** profile Partner section (just like a family
   invitation).
2. A pending request shows "waiting for *X* to confirm", with a **withdraw**
   action if you change your mind.
3. To end a confirmed partnership, remove it from the Partner section — the other
   person is emailed, and any shared double-bed placements you both held are
   released back to the club for re-allocation.

If you are a family-group admin, you can instead declare a no-login adult member
of your own group as your partner in one step. The partner rules are in
[`STATE_MACHINES.md`](../STATE_MACHINES.md#partner-link-lifecycle-declared-partnerhusbandwife-1742).

## What to expect

| Action | What to expect |
| --- | --- |
| Request to join / create a group | Goes to the club for review before it takes effect |
| Add a dependent (infant/child/youth) | Requested via your group; no login is created for them |
| Invite an adult | They confirm from their own profile |
| Declare a partner by email | They confirm from their own profile Partner section |
| Unregistered partner by email | They are emailed a claim link that routes them through joining, then into your group |
| Remove a confirmed partner | The other person is emailed; shared double-bed placements are released |

Both people in a partnership must be **adults**, and each member can have at most
**one** confirmed partner. Family billing (who pays for the household) is set by
the club; see the operator [Family Groups](../guides/family-groups.md) guide.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Why it happens | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The Join / Create buttons are gone | You already have a pending family-group request | Wait for the club to review it; the pending note shows what you submitted |
| Your partner request is stuck on "waiting to confirm" | They have not confirmed from their own profile yet | Ask them to open **Profile → Partner** and confirm; you can withdraw and re-send |
| "If they're eligible, we've sent them a partner request" | A privacy-safe response — a member who already has a partner looks the same as an eligible one | If they are eligible they will get the request; otherwise contact the club office |
| The NZ address lookup is unavailable when adding details | The autocomplete service is off or unconfigured | Enter the address by hand — the fields still work |
| You cannot cancel a pending family-group request yourself | Members cannot cancel a pending group request in this version | Ask the club office to reject it |
