# The waitlist & offers

Audience: Member

## What it is

What to do when the nights you want are **full**: join the waitlist, and — if a
bed frees up — accept the offer before it expires. You join the waitlist from the
booking wizard (`/book`) when a night is full, and you act on an offer from **My
Bookings** (`/bookings`) and the emails the club sends. The waitlist states are
in [`STATE_MACHINES.md`](../STATE_MACHINES.md#waitlist-lifecycle).

## When you'd use it

- The nights you want show as **Full** in the booking calendar.
- You are happy to take a different lodge if one has room (where your club runs
  more than one lodge).
- You have received a waitlist **offer** and need to accept it before it lapses.

## Step-by-step

### 1. Join the waitlist

1. In the booking wizard, choose the nights you want. If they are **Full**, the
   wizard offers to add you to the **waitlist** instead of booking.
2. If your club runs more than one lodge, you can **opt into alternate lodges** —
   so an offer can come from another lodge that frees up, not only the one you
   first chose.
3. Join the waitlist. Your waitlisted entry appears in **My Bookings** with a
   **Waitlist** status; a later offer shows as **Waitlist Offered**.

### 2. Accept an offer before it expires

1. When a bed frees up, the club offers it to you — you are emailed and the entry
   in **My Bookings** flips to **Waitlist Offered**.
2. Open the offer and **accept it before it expires**. The offer states its
   expiry; if it lapses, the place can pass to the next person on the list.
3. If the offer is for a **different lodge** than you first chose (a cross-lodge
   offer), it names the lodge and its **price** — which may differ from your
   original lodge — and asks you to **confirm explicitly**. Accepting books a
   fresh entry at the offered lodge.
4. Once you accept, settle any payment due exactly as for a normal booking — see
   [Paying for your stay](paying-for-your-stay.md).

## What to expect

| Thing | What to expect |
| --- | --- |
| Joining the waitlist | Only offered when your chosen nights are full |
| Alternate lodges | Opt in to receive offers from other lodges (multi-lodge clubs) |
| Getting an offer | You are emailed and the entry shows **Waitlist Offered** in My Bookings |
| Offer expiry | Each offer expires; accept before then or it may pass on |
| Cross-lodge offer | Names the lodge and its price (which can differ) and needs explicit confirmation |
| After accepting | Pay as normal; a cross-lodge accept creates a fresh booking at that lodge |

Prices are shown in dollars. The cross-lodge alternate-lodge behaviour follows
the club's multi-lodge configuration.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Why it happens | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Your offer will not accept | It has expired, or capacity changed again before you accepted | If it lapsed, you keep your place in line for the next opening; contact the club office if unsure |
| The offered price is not what you expected | It is a cross-lodge offer at a lodge with different rates | The offer names the lodge and price; confirm only if you are happy with it |
| You are not getting offers for other lodges | You did not opt into alternate lodges when you joined | Re-join the waitlist and opt into alternate lodges |
| The offer says a bed is needed but payment is required | Accepting an offer still needs the booking paid | Accept, then pay from the booking's **Complete Payment** card |
