# Export & Import (config transfer)

Audience: Operator

## What it is

A full-admin tool that exports your club's **configuration, site content, and
lodge setup** as a single portable `.zip` bundle, and imports such a bundle into
another (or the same) instance through a **preview → apply** flow that never
deletes. Find it at **Admin → Setup & Configuration → Export & Import**
(`/admin/config-transfer`).

Only **Full Admins** can open this page (others see a "full administrators only"
notice). It is **not** a database backup: importing never removes anything added
since the export, and members, bookings, payments, and other transactional data
are never included. The full contract — categories, validation rules, and safety
model — lives in the [config-transfer feature hub](../config-transfer/README.md).

## When you'd use it

- Cloning a configured club into a new environment (staging → production, or a
  fresh fork).
- Moving site content, lodge setup, or fee schedules between instances without
  re-entering them by hand.
- Taking a portable, human-editable snapshot of configuration to review or edit.

## Step-by-step

### Export a bundle

1. Go to **Admin → Setup & Configuration → Export & Import**.

   ![Configuration Export & Import page with the export category checkboxes and the import upload / dry-run panel](../images/admin/admin-config-transfer.png)

2. In **Export**, tick the categories to include. **Include lodge door codes** is
   an opt-in checkbox (physical-access information), off by default.
3. Click **Export bundle** to download `config-transfer-<date>.zip`.

### Import a bundle

1. In **Import**, choose a `.zip` file and click **Preview (dry-run)** — nothing
   is written yet. The plan shows, per entity, what would be **New**, **Updated**,
   or **Unchanged**, plus any door-code, Xero-org, or edited-bundle warnings.
2. Pick a **write mode** — **Merge** (recommended; only fields with a value in
   the bundle are written) or **Overwrite** (the bundle fully defines each
   record; blank fields clear it). You can also untick categories or resolve a
   rename via its match picker; each change re-previews.
3. If validation shows **errors**, Apply stays disabled — fix the bundle, use
   **Reseal edited bundle** to regenerate its manifest, and re-preview. When the
   plan is clean, click **Apply import**: the server takes a `pg_dump` backup
   first, then applies in one transaction.

## Settings reference

Exportable categories:

| Category | Contains |
| --- | --- |
| Site content & appearance | CMS pages, keyed site content, club theme (embedded images travel in the bundle) |
| Club settings | Club-wide singletons: modules, booking defaults, member fields, club identity, email message settings, etc. |
| Lodge configuration | Lodges, rooms, beds, seasons, season rates, lodge instructions, chore templates |
| Committee (roles) | `CommitteeRole` definitions only (not member-linked assignments) |
| Induction checklists | Induction templates with their sections and items |
| Membership fees (joining & annual) | Joining-fee and annual-fee schedules with invoice-line components (integer cents) |
| Xero configuration | Xero account and item-code mappings |

| Control | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Include lodge door codes | Opt-in; adds physical-access door codes to the export |
| Write mode: Merge / Overwrite | Merge patches only bundled fields; Overwrite makes the bundle authoritative (blank clears) |
| Categories to import | Untick to import a subset (re-previews) |
| Match picker | Resolve an unmatched season/chore/induction template as *create new* or *match existing* |
| Reseal edited bundle | Regenerate the manifest after hand-editing a bundle |

Import **never deletes**; the automatic pre-apply `pg_dump` backup is the true
rollback. Validation errors (bad dates, non-integer money, invalid slugs, unknown
keys) **block** apply until fixed.

### Settings your club has never saved

A club-wide setting you have never opened and saved still has a value — the
built-in default the software runs on. Those settings **do travel** in a bundle:
the export writes the built-in defaults in place of the setting you never saved,
so importing the bundle moves the source club's settings across rather than
quietly leaving the target club's own values in place.

Three consequences worth knowing:

- **Importing creates the settings record**, even for a setting nobody ever
  configured. On the target club, **Admin → Setup** will then count booking
  defaults, group discount, membership cancellation, and module controls as
  *configured* or *checked*. The values are the same defaults it was already
  using — only the "has this been reviewed?" signal changes. Review those four
  steps after an import.
- **A default that ships changed in a later release no longer reaches that
  club**, because the value is now written down rather than resolved fresh each
  time. Change it deliberately in the admin if you want a different value.
- **The group-discount card's Save button** is greyed out on an untouched card
  after an import. Before, an unsaved group-discount setting left Save enabled
  so you could create the record; the import has now created it. Change a value
  and Save works as normal.

Club identity and email message settings work slightly differently. Their fields
— club name, short name, hut-leader label, Facebook URL, support and contact
addresses, public URL — are optional overrides on top of the values in the
install's own configuration file. When the source club **has** set them they are
exported and imported like any other setting, so a transfer does move the
source's club name and addresses onto the target; that is intended, and it is
why applying a bundle refreshes the club identity straight away. It is only when
the source club has never set any override that the bundle carries "no override"
rather than the source install's own fallback identity, and in that case the
import leaves the target's identity alone entirely — in **Overwrite** mode it
will clear an existing target override, but it never creates an identity record
where there was none.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "available to full administrators only" | You aren't a Full Admin | Ask a Full Admin to run the transfer |
| Apply is disabled | The plan has validation errors | Fix the named rows, **Reseal**, and re-preview |
| Errors naming a legacy `isMember` column or an `ENTRANCE_FEE` item-code row, with Apply disabled | The bundle was exported by **v0.12.2 or earlier** — that bundle shape is no longer imported | Re-export the bundle from the source install if it is still running the current release; otherwise hand-fix the columns as below, **Reseal**, and re-preview |
| `item-code-mappings.csv` error: "a HUT_FEE item-code row must name a membership type" | A hand-authored (or hand-edited) HUT_FEE row left `membershipTypeKey` blank | Fill in the membership type key — the exporter always emits one — then **Reseal** and re-preview |
| A fresh install came up **unconfigured** and the logs say nothing was written | The boot-time bundle at `CONFIG_BUNDLE_IMPORT_PATH` failed validation, so the auto-import refused (`refused-invalid`) and wrote nothing — a legacy bundle is the usual cause | Read the boot log line, which names the first validation error; replace the file with a current-shape export (or hand-fix and reseal it) and reboot, or import the bundle interactively on this page |
| "This bundle was edited since export" warning | Manifest checksums don't match the files | Advisory only — apply anyway, or **Reseal** to refresh the manifest |
| Xero org mismatch warning | The Xero config came from a different connected org | Verify the codes, or untick the Xero category before applying |
| A door-code change warning appears | The bundle would set/change a lodge door code | Confirm it's intended before applying |
| A "restore" didn't remove stale rows | Import never deletes | Remove them on the owning admin page; the backup is the true rollback |

### Converting a legacy bundle by hand

If the install that produced an old bundle is gone and all you hold is the zip,
you do not have to abandon it. Bundles are plain CSVs in a zip and are meant to
be edited: unzip it, make the three substitutions below, re-zip it, upload it,
click **Reseal edited bundle** to regenerate the manifest, and re-preview. The
old shape used a `true`/`false` "is this a member?" column where the current
shape names the **membership type** directly.

| File | Old column / value | Change it to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lodge-config/lodges/<slug>/season-rates.csv` | `isMember` column, `true` | a `membershipTypeKey` column with `FULL` |
| `lodge-config/lodges/<slug>/season-rates.csv` | `isMember` column, `false` | a `membershipTypeKey` column with `NON_MEMBER` |
| `xero-config/item-code-mappings.csv` (HUT_FEE rows) | `isMember` column, `true` / `false` | a `membershipTypeKey` column with `FULL` / `NON_MEMBER` |
| `xero-config/item-code-mappings.csv` | `category` value `ENTRANCE_FEE` | `JOINING_FEE` (the same rows, renamed) |

Practical notes:

- **Rename the header, not just the values.** Replace the `isMember` header cell
  with `membershipTypeKey` and rewrite each row's `true`/`false` to `FULL` /
  `NON_MEMBER`. A row that still carries an `isMember` value with no
  `membershipTypeKey` is what triggers the rejection.
- `FULL` and `NON_MEMBER` are the built-in membership type **keys**. If your club
  renamed or replaced them, use the keys shown on **Admin → Membership Types** —
  an unknown key is its own clear row error.
- Leave `JOINING_FEE` rows' `membershipTypeKey` **blank**; that column keys
  HUT_FEE rows only.
- The dry-run is safe to repeat as often as you like — nothing is written until
  you click **Apply import** — so fix, reseal, re-preview, and iterate until the
  plan is clean.
