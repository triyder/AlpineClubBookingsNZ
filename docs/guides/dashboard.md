# Admin Dashboard

Audience: Operator

## What it is

The admin landing page: a set of **attention cards** for work that needs a
decision, headline **stat cards** for the club's numbers, a **Recent Bookings**
list, and **Quick Actions** shortcuts. Find it at **Admin → Admin Dashboard**
(`/admin/dashboard`).

Everything on the dashboard is a link into the area that owns the detail — the
dashboard never edits anything itself. The attention cards mirror the sidebar's
**Needs Attention** section (see [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md) →
Needs Attention / badges): a card appears only while its queue has something
pending and disappears once the queue is clear, so it never implies work that
isn't there.

## When you'd use it

- You've just logged in and want the one-screen view of what needs doing today.
- You want a quick count of active members, active bookings, or this month's
  revenue without opening the detailed reports.
- You want to jump to a pending queue (refund appeals, booking reviews, deletion
  requests) straight from the alert that surfaced it.

## Step-by-step

### Read the dashboard

1. Go to **Admin → Admin Dashboard**.

2. Scan the **attention cards** at the top. Each is a shortcut to the queue that
   raised it — click through to act on it.
3. Use the **stat cards** for the headline numbers, or the **Quick Actions**
   tiles to jump to Members, Seasons, Bookings, Promo Codes, or the Chore
   Roster.

### Find any page fast (command palette)

The admin panel has around ninety pages across ten sidebar sections, so you
don't have to remember which section hides a feature.

- Press **Ctrl + K** (Windows/Linux) or **⌘ + K** (Mac) from any admin page, or
  click the **Search…** button at the top of the sidebar.
- Start typing a page name — or a related word, such as "accounting" for Xero
  Sync or "permissions" for Access Roles — then use the **arrow keys** to move,
  **Enter** to open the highlighted page, and **Escape** to close.
- The palette only ever lists pages **you** can open: it applies exactly the
  same permission rules as the sidebar, so a page you aren't permitted to see
  never appears here.
- It lists every page the sidebar *could* show you, which is slightly more than
  the sidebar shows at any one moment. The two attention shortcuts — **Unpaid
  Finished Stays** and **Unpaid Stay Additions** — stay searchable as
  pre-filtered views even when nothing is currently owing, whereas the sidebar
  only surfaces them while their queue has something in it.

## Settings reference

The dashboard has no settings — it is read-only. The cards it can show:

| Card | Appears when | Opens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pending Review Queue | Refund appeals or manual credit approvals are waiting | [Refunds & Credits](refund-requests.md) |
| Booking Requests | New booking reviews or change requests are waiting | [Booking Requests](booking-requests.md) |
| Unpaid Finished Stays | A stay ended but is still payment-pending | [Bookings](bookings.md) (pre-filtered) |
| Finished Stays With Unpaid Additions | A settled past stay has an upward change still uncollected | [Bookings](bookings.md) (pre-filtered) |
| Account Deletion Requests | A member self-service deletion is pending | [Deletion Requests](deletion-requests.md) |
| Membership Lifecycle Review | A cancellation or archive request is waiting | [Cancellation Requests](membership-cancellations.md) |
| Hut Leader Assignment Required | Upcoming dates have bookings but no hut leader | Hut Leaders (lodge operations; guide lands in batch 3) |

Stat cards (each links to its detail area):

| Stat | What it counts |
| --- | --- |
| Members | Active members, with the total and inactive count |
| Total Bookings | All-time bookings (excludes deleted) |
| Active Bookings | Payment-pending, paid, confirmed, and hold statuses |
| Revenue This Month | Sum of **succeeded** payments this calendar month (integer cents) |
| Upcoming Check-ins | Active bookings checking in within the next 7 NZ days |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| An attention card vanished | Its queue is now empty | Nothing to do — the card only shows while work is pending |
| Revenue looks low | It counts only **succeeded** payments in the current NZ month | Use [Reports](reports.md) or [Payments](payments.md) for full figures |
| A quick-action tile is missing | The related module is off (e.g. Chore Roster needs the `chores` module) | Enable it in [Modules](modules.md) |
