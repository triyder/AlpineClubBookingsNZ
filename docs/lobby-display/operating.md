# Lobby TV Display — Operating and Extending

Practical guides that sit alongside the [design specification](design.md): a
runbook for the admin who sets up a screen, and a developer guide for adding a
module or a condition. Terminology (Layout / Template / Module / Condition) is
defined in [design.md §6](design.md#6-layout--template--module-model).

---

## For operators — set up a screen

The feature is **off by default**. An organisation admin must first enable the
**Lobby Display** module for the club; until then no display routes, admin UI, or
tokens exist.

The whole admin surface lives under one sidebar entry, **Lobby Display**
(`/admin/display`), a hub of cards: **Devices**, **Layouts**, **Templates**, and
**Reference**. Per-lodge display settings live on the lodge configuration hub
(**Admin → Lodges → [lodge]**), not under Lobby Display.

### 1. Pair the device

1. In **Lobby Display → Devices** (`/admin/display/devices`), create a device
   record: give it a name (e.g. "Lobby TV") and it is bound to a lodge. The page
   shows the concrete display URL to open on the screen.
2. On the TV/browser (or Raspberry Pi), open `/display`. Unpaired, it shows a
   short **pairing code**. The code expires after 15 minutes; a fresh one appears
   automatically.
3. Back in the admin Devices page, enter/confirm that code against the device
   record. On its next poll the screen claims a long-lived, **hashed**,
   revocable display token (stored as an httpOnly cookie) and reloads into
   display mode. It survives reboots and network blips; re-pairing is only needed
   after revocation or expiry.

The state poll doubles as a heartbeat, so the device's **last seen** updates on
its normal refresh cadence. You can **revoke** a device at any time; it returns
to the pairing screen within one refresh interval.

### 2. Assign a Template

Each device shows the **club-default board** until you bind it to a Template.

- Pick a Template from the device's template selector (**Devices** page). The
  three built-ins — **Everyday board**, **Whole lodge**, **Singles house** —
  appear as ordinary Templates, alongside any you have authored.
- Choosing "club default" clears the binding (`templateId: null`).
- To try a Template before it reaches a wall, use **Preview**: each device offers
  a preview (opening `/display?previewDevice=<id>`), and each Template offers a
  sandboxed preview against a chosen lodge. Previews render through the same
  privacy-reduced data, never stamp "last seen", and can simulate a date via the
  header date line.

Templates render dynamically against whichever lodge the device is bound to, so
one Template serves every lodge — lodge-specific values come from
`{{config:…}}` tokens (below), never from hard-coded content.

### 3. Set the per-lodge display config

On **Admin → Lodges → [lodge]**, the **Lobby Display settings** card (below the
Capacity card, shown only when the module is enabled) holds the three per-lodge
controls. It edits **the lodge you are viewing**:

- **Guest name display (granularity).** Full names / first name + surname
  initial / first names only / counts only, or "club default". This is enforced
  in the display data feed itself — no Template can reveal more than the chosen
  level, and bookings with children always collapse to a family label.
- **Committee notice.** A free-text notice shown wherever a Template places the
  notice module; `{{config:key}}` placeholders resolve inside it. Leave empty to
  hide it (the notice areas in the built-ins are gated on `content:notice`).
- **Config values** — the `{{config:key}}` glob. Add key/value pairs (keys are
  lower-case slugs, e.g. `wifi-code`); Templates reference them as
  `{{config:wifi-code}}`. The built-in footer reads `wifi-name`, `wifi-code`,
  `contact-email`, and `footer-note`; any other key is yours to use in a
  Template. Bad keys/values are rejected (400) by the shared config route.
- **Phone toggle** — "Show guest phone numbers on the lobby display". This is the
  lodge side of a **two-sided consent gate**: a phone appears only when the lodge
  enables this **and** the member has opted in, and only for an adult on a row
  that already shows individual names. Both flags default off. See
  [`phone-visibility.md`](phone-visibility.md).

> **Single-lodge clubs:** the lodge configuration hub (`/admin/lodges/[id]`) is
> unconditional — it is gated only on the `lobbyDisplay` module, not on
> multi-lodge — so `LodgeDisplaySettingsCard` is reachable there for
> single-lodge installs too. The values are per-lodge by construction and a
> single-lodge club is its own default lodge.

> **Privacy model, plainly stated:** minors are never individually named on
> any board, at any granularity level — that is a hard rule with no override.
> Group-label collapse — a family label for a booking containing minors, the
> organisation's name for a school/club organiser, or the booking's own label
> for a whole-lodge blockout — applies consistently across every board,
> including the **chores** board: an adult chore assignee in one of these
> bookings is never named more precisely than that booking's row already is
> elsewhere on the wall. This is a **presentation default that protects
> group privacy day to day, not a certified anonymisation boundary** — treat
> it as good practice, not as a compliance guarantee. The **hut-leader
> kiosk** is the deliberate operational exception: it shows full names,
> because staff checking guests in and out need them.

## For developers — extending

The Module library and the condition vocabulary are **closed registries**: you
grow them by shipping code, not by admins writing expressions. Both are wired so
that adding an entry is a small, well-bounded change — but touch **every**
touch-point or a load-time guard / CI test will fail.

### Add a module

A module is a React component that is a **pure function of the `DisplayState`
payload** (it must never query anything). Touch-points, all under
`src/`:

1. **Component** — add `components/lodge-display/modules/<your-module>.tsx`,
   exporting a component of `DisplayModuleProps` (`{ state, options? }`). Read
   only `DisplayState` fields; render nothing rather than throwing on missing
   data.
2. **Name registry** — add the module's name to `DISPLAY_MODULE_NAMES` in
   `lib/lodge-display/template-registry.ts` (the closed set the validators
   accept). This is the single source of truth for valid module names.
3. **Metadata** — add a `DisplayModuleMetadata` entry in
   `lib/lodge-display/module-registry.ts`: `label`, `description` (admin-facing —
   it appears in the Reference screen and seeds authoring dropdowns),
   `dependencies` (club-module flags from `DISPLAY_RELEVANT_MODULE_KEYS`),
   `dependencyMode` (`degrades` or `hides`), the stable `cssHooks` class names,
   any `contributes` conditions, and `embedToken`. A load-time guard throws if a
   name in `DISPLAY_MODULE_NAMES` has no metadata entry, so this cannot be
   skipped.
4. **Component map** — register the component in `DISPLAY_MODULE_COMPONENTS` in
   `components/lodge-display/modules/index.tsx`, wrapped in `withModuleGuard(name,
   …)` (the guard enforces `hides` at the render boundary). Page furniture
   (`lodge-header` / `info-footer`) is instead wired into `PAGE_MODULE_COMPONENTS`
   in `app/display/display-screen.tsx`.
5. **CSS** — add styles in `app/display/display.css`, targeting the class hooks
   you declared in step 3. A CSS-hook stability test fails CI if a declared hook
   is renamed without updating the metadata, so the class-name contract stays
   honest.

The Reference screen, the authoring dropdowns, and the render-boundary guard all
read from the registries above, so a correctly-registered module surfaces
everywhere with no further wiring.

### Add a condition or capability

Conditions gate any area and drive rotator eligibility. They live in
`lib/lodge-display/conditions.ts`, each a **pure function of `DisplayState`**.

- **A core condition** (an `occupancy:*` or `content:*` state) — add a
  `DisplayConditionDefinition` to `CORE_CONDITIONS` with a `name`
  (`namespace:name`), `family`, `description` (feeds the Reference screen), and
  `evaluate(state)`. Names are validated by `isDisplayConditionName`, so the new
  name is immediately selectable in the authoring dropdowns and rejected nowhere.
- **A capability (`<module>:enabled`) condition** — add the module's flag to
  `DISPLAY_RELEVANT_MODULE_KEYS` (mapping the camelCase module key to a
  namespace slug, e.g. `bedAllocation → "bed-allocation"`). This single line
  does two things: it **generates** the `<slug>:enabled` condition (inheriting
  the module's label from `MODULE_DEFINITIONS`), and it **bounds which module
  flags reach the public payload** — `buildDisplayState` copies only these onto
  `DisplayState.capabilities`, so the whole club flag map never ships to a wall.
- **A module data condition** (like `chores:today`) — add it to
  `MODULE_DATA_CONDITIONS`; its `evaluate` may read `state.capabilities` and
  payload data together.

Because the evaluator only ever sees `DisplayState`, a condition can never reach
past the privacy serialiser — it decides *whether* to show an area, never *what*
it may show.
