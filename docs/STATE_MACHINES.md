# State Machines

This is a first-pass map for review planning. It intentionally marks uncertain
or implementation-specific details as "to verify in later review" rather than
inventing certainty.

## Booking Lifecycle

Known schema statuses: `DRAFT`, `PENDING`, `PAYMENT_PENDING`, `CONFIRMED`,
`PAID`, `BUMPED`, `CANCELLED`, `COMPLETED`, `WAITLISTED`,
`WAITLIST_OFFERED`, `AWAITING_REVIEW`.

```text
DRAFT -> PENDING or PAYMENT_PENDING -> CONFIRMED or PAID -> COMPLETED
PENDING -> CONFIRMED/PAID or BUMPED/CANCELLED
WAITLISTED -> WAITLIST_OFFERED -> CONFIRMED/PAID or WAITLISTED/CANCELLED
AWAITING_REVIEW -> PENDING (quote accepted, #1254) or CONFIRMED/PAID or CANCELLED
```

### Minimum-stay exception foundation (#2363)

A minimum-stay violation causes **no booking-state transition** in this release.
Member booking create, member group join, and ordinary date modification (on the
live `modify` route as well as `modify-dates`) keep their blocking HTTP 400
behavior for non-admin actors. The public non-member group join now blocks at
both of its stages: the staging request never reaches `GroupBookingJoin` (no
token, no row, no email), and the verification step re-reads the current policy
set and returns a 409 `minimum_stay` outcome instead of creating the non-login
member, the PENDING child booking, the PENDING payment and the pay link — so a
rule tightened during the link's 48-hour life fails closed rather than admitting
the stay. Quote and policy-check endpoints return advisory facts, and the
booking wizard continues to show the existing message without advancing. The
authenticated responses now carry a frozen `exceptionReview` whose violations
include the policy version, so the later workflow can present one combined
review without reconstructing what the member encountered; the two PUBLIC
non-member group-join stages deliberately carry none of it — they answer with a
generic sentence and their code/outcome, and the snapshot reaches the club only
through the server log line each stage writes.

Accepting a waitlist offer can also end in **no transition at all** without
being a refusal: the same-lodge minimum-stay check runs on an unlocked read
before the claiming transaction, so the claim refuses with `CONFIRM_RETRY`
(HTTP 409) when it finds a live offer the check never classified — an entry the
offer sweep moved `WAITLISTED -> WAITLIST_OFFERED` in between, or one that
became a cross-lodge offer. Nothing is written, so the state machine is exactly
where it was and the member simply confirms again.

The `HOLD`/`NO_HOLD` value in that snapshot is policy metadata today. No
exception request is persisted and no capacity is held or released because of
it. #2365 adds the durable request/approval states, revalidation, and capacity
reservation rules. Until that work lands, capacity exhaustion, subscription or
membership refusal, duplicate member-night, authentication, payment, privacy,
invalid-date, and data-integrity failures remain hard stops with no transition
into review.

### Adult-member hosting review (#2364)

In `ADMIN_REVIEW_REQUIRED`, an adult-member hosting hazard causes **no
booking-state transition**: the booking exists and a review lives beside its
lifecycle in dedicated columns. In `ENFORCED`, the non-compliant create or
modification instead rolls back with the waivable 409 and may enter the shared
policy-exception request lifecycle; no booking transition is invented for a
write that did not commit. Once a booking exists through review mode, an approved
exception, or an explicit admin on-behalf reason, its hosting review has this
small state machine:

```
(none) -> PENDING            a hazard appears on a booking that had none
(none) -> APPROVED           create only, and only with an explicit admin
                             on-behalf reason recorded against it (D-R4)
PENDING|APPROVED|REJECTED -> (none)
                             current facts cover every affected night, or the
                             policy stops applying to this booking
PENDING|APPROVED|REJECTED -> PENDING
                             a MATERIALLY different hazard replaced the recorded
                             one (a different uncovered guest-night set, or a
                             different policy revision); the previous decision is
                             dropped with it
```

Two of those edges are the whole point. Clearing is automatic and needs no admin:
adding an adult member to the booking, adding eligible same-owner cover at that
lodge/night, removing the last uncovered guest, moving the nights, reinstating a
cancelled member, switching the policy off, or moving the booking to a lodge that
never had the rule all end the hazard the next time a relevant path touches it.
Reopening is deliberately NARROW: a renamed guest, or an extra host on an
already-covered night, is the same hazard and does not re-prompt an admin who has
already decided.

"Touches it" includes touching its #738 SPLIT SIBLING. The child borrows its
parent's adults, so the parent's own nights and guests move the child's answer;
every mutation path therefore re-derives both halves in one transaction. A
sibling always enters at PENDING — the `(none) -> APPROVED` edge needs an
explicit reason from the admin who was asked, and nobody was asked about a
booking they only reached through another one.

An accepted booking that later loses same-owner cover has a separate durable
incident lifecycle, still without changing `Booking.status`:

```text
(none) -> OPEN                 committed cover loss is reconciled after the write
OPEN -> RESOLVED               COVERAGE_RESTORED | BOOKING_AMENDED |
                               EXCEPTION_APPROVED | BOOKING_CANCELLED
RESOLVED -> OPEN               a later materially different uncovered state appears
```

Adding a new active covering booking therefore resolves the existing incident as
`COVERAGE_RESTORED`; it does not cancel or recreate the dependent booking. The
queue item that drives this transition is part of the mutation transaction. Under
#2597, a member-standing fan-out first locks its subject `FOR UPDATE NOWAIT`, then
an ordinary producer locks its exact owner/actor Member participants with sorted
`FOR KEY SHARE NOWAIT`. A booking-request hold takes its lodge key and the exact
linked members `FOR KEY SHARE`, then re-reads every row as active and unarchived
before its versioned claim or any guest creation. Hold-first makes the standing
mutation retry; standing-first makes the hold wait and then refuse the now-inactive
member in every hosting consequence mode. Member merge takes one sorted blocking
`FOR UPDATE` set, re-plans, and sweeps late owner and actor rows before deleting the
loser. If either side cannot prove the exact attribution, the complete mutation
returns the safe retry outcome and none of the booking, member, queue or incident
states advance. Merge-generated work is actorless; the critical `MEMBER_MERGED`
audit remains its human attribution.

The “complete mutation” above means the database transaction that contains the
queue write; it is not a promise that an earlier provider or workflow phase can be
undone. Two interactive boundaries expose that distinction explicitly:

```text
Stripe capture succeeded -> confirm-payment participant retry
  -> paymentReceived=true, finalisationPending=true
  -> keep payment UI in place; check booking/payment status before retrying

Xero contact fetched -> local member created -> Xero contact linked
  -> subscription refresh participant retry
  -> memberImported=true, xeroContactLinked=true,
     subscriptionRefreshPending=true
  -> select the created member; repair subscription history; do not import again
```

Booking-approval (including admin waitlist force-confirm), member draft-confirm,
public-request and Xero action consumers announce the fixed 409 in a permanently
mounted alert and focus/scroll the action failure. A participant-fence retry that
proved rollback may restore its control. A network or unreadable waitlist
response cannot prove that, so the member-facing offer suppresses another
confirm and offers only **Reload booking status** until canonical state is read;
the zero-dollar draft and admin waitlist surfaces likewise describe the outcome
as unverified and require reload/status verification before retry. Ordinary Xero
subscription-history failures still complete the import with the existing repair
warning; only the participant-fence code takes the fixed 409 path.

The hosting review itself never reuses the shared `AWAITING_REVIEW` booking status
or the minors-only check-in block. An enforced refusal may instead enter the
durable booking-policy exception lifecycle, whose frozen capacity choice,
approval/revalidation transitions, and member/officer actions are documented in
the policy-exception sections above.

`DRAFT -> PAYMENT_PENDING` is also where a stored account-credit election is
spent (#2265). A draft carries the member's election on
`Booking.creditElectionCents` and consumes no credit while it may still be
abandoned; the pay path (`create-payment-intent`) advances the status, applies
the election clamped to the live balance and the price, and clears the column —
all in one transaction, so the transition and the money move together and a
retry cannot spend the election twice. When the election covers the whole price
the same transaction continues straight to `PAID` with a $0 SUCCEEDED payment
rather than minting a card intent — as does a draft that was repriced to $0
while the member was looking at the pay step. Any booking held in
`AWAITING_REVIEW` keeps its election through review and spends it on the
`AWAITING_REVIEW -> PAYMENT_PENDING` release instead; that release path claims
capacity before it settles, honouring a persisted capacity override (#1771),
and refuses with a 409 (election intact, nothing charged) when the beds are
gone. `confirm-draft` only ever settles a $0 booking, where credit has nothing
to pay, so it clears the election without consuming any. Switching to Internet
Banking consumes the election too, so the Xero invoice is raised for what the
member actually owes; when credit covers the whole price there is nothing to
invoice, so the switch is refused and the booking is settled at $0 on the pay
step instead.

The election is WRITTEN by two producers: booking-create (draft save and
review-parked creates, #2265) and the edit path (#2266) — a member editing a
`DRAFT`, an actor editing an `AWAITING_REVIEW` or `PAYMENT_PENDING` booking.
The edit refuses to write a positive election onto any other status (notably
`PENDING`: `charge-saved-method` requires PENDING and consumes no election, so
no election-bearing booking may ever sit there) and clears it when the edit
itself settles the booking at $0. Members may edit their own `DRAFT` bookings
(#2266): a draft edit changes stored numbers only — no capacity claim, no hold
stamp, no change fee — and the `DRAFT -> PAYMENT_PENDING` / `confirm-draft`
doors keep enforcing capacity and holds exactly as above.

Every transition INTO a settled status clears the election if one is somehow
still on the row (#2319), because nothing reads the column after settlement and a
non-NULL value there would advertise an outstanding request forever:
`markBookingPaymentSucceeded`'s `PAID` claim (the door the Stripe webhook, the
session confirm, the payment link, the saved-card charge and the auto-confirm
cron share), the Internet Banking reconcile's `PAID` flip and its
late-capacity-failure `CANCELLED` flip, and the repriced-to-$0 auto-pay in both
modification services — the last of which is the one arm that can genuinely get
there, when a guest removal releases a review-parked booking to `PAYMENT_PENDING`
and reprices the stay to nothing in the same edit. A clear on a $0 settle is
silent (nothing was owed); a clear where real money was taken writes a
`booking.credit_election.unapplied` audit row that the member's booking history
renders, plus an operator alert. `PENDING -> PAID` via the public payment link is
the exception that never needs it: that route refuses a booking carrying an
election outright rather than charging the pre-credit price.

Waitlist confirmation and expiry serialize on the offered booking's lodge lock.
Confirmation re-reads `WAITLIST_OFFERED` and the deadline after acquiring the
lock and uses a status/deadline-guarded claim, so an expiry that wins first
cannot be resurrected. The route's separate zero-dollar `PAYMENT_PENDING ->
PAID` capacity claim takes global then lodge locks; if capacity disappeared,
it restores `WAITLISTED` in that transaction so normal re-offering can retry.
Generic `PAYMENT_PENDING` does not hold a bed.

Capacity-holding is not a pure function of status (#1254, refining #737). A
booking holds beds when its status is capacity-holding (PAID, COMPLETED,
CONFIRMED, AWAITING_REVIEW), **or** it is PENDING and is the converted booking
of a `BookingRequest` (an accepted-but-unpaid quote / approved request), **or**
it is PAYMENT_PENDING and carries an **admin capacity hold** (#1764,
`adminCapacityHoldAt` set — an orthogonal flag, NOT a status: the lifecycle
status keeps meaning what it means). Generic PENDING (split-booking children
#738, member "only-if-my-guests-come" holds) still does not hold and stays
bumpable, and PAYMENT_PENDING without an admin hold stays non-holding. The
single source of truth is `capacityHoldingBookingFilter()` in
`src/lib/booking-status.ts`; every availability query uses it.

Admin capacity hold interaction (#1764): Hold is admin-only
(`POST /api/admin/bookings/[id]/capacity-hold`), allowed only on a
PAYMENT_PENDING booking that does not already hold capacity, taken under the
per-lodge advisory lock with a capacity re-check (409 CAPACITY_EXCEEDED unless
an explicit overbook is confirmed, mirroring force-confirm). Unhold (`DELETE`
on the same route) releases the beds and is refused (409) once the booking
holds capacity naturally — releasing a paid/confirmed booking's capacity stays
impossible. A natural transition (payment success -> PAID etc.) needs no hold
handshake: the filter's clauses are OR'd, so capacity is counted exactly once
and the hold record simply becomes inert; if a settlement failure later
reverts the booking to PAYMENT_PENDING (group-settlement reaper), the still-set
hold re-engages seamlessly — capacity was continuously held either way. Every
cancel-shaped transition (cancel routes, group-child cancel, settlement
reaper expiry, Internet Banking hold release, capacity-failed settlement)
clears the hold fields via the shared `RELEASE_ADMIN_CAPACITY_HOLD_UPDATE`
fragment — no orphaned holds. Both actions write audit rows
(`booking.admin_capacity_hold.placed[_overbook]` / `.released`). Consequence: an accepted-but-unpaid quote booking
keeps its bed until it is paid, expires, or is cancelled, and a later member
booking can no longer bump it. One deliberate exception (owner-ratified, #1317):
an accepted-but-unpaid hold is NOT protected against a *capacity reduction* — if
an admin lowers the lodge capacity for those nights below what is booked, the
`cron-confirm-pending` job bumps/cancels the still-unpaid hold at its hold
deadline (no charge). Only an admin capacity cut can reclaim the bed; competing
member bookings still cannot. The admin "Confirm pending guests" override
(`/api/admin/bookings/[id]/confirm-pending-guests`) now runs the same
global `pg_advisory_xact_lock(1)` -> per-lodge capacity-lock -> mutable re-read
and capacity re-check before flipping a booking to a capacity-holding status on
its zero-dollar and charge-saved-card branches, returning 409 unless an explicit
overbook is requested (#1366, #1881). Its
charge-saved-card branch follows the cron's claim-first shape (#1418): claim
`PENDING -> CONFIRMED` (hold cleared) under the lock, charge outside it, then
promote to PAID. A failed or requires-action charge releases the claim back to
`PENDING` with the hold restored and (on failure) alerts admins; a captured
charge is durably recorded as a PRIMARY payment transaction before promotion,
so if the promotion fails the booking stays CONFIRMED holding its beds, admins
are alerted, and the Stripe webhook finishes the promotion idempotently —
captured money is never silently orphaned.

Split-booking guest-portion settlement with no card on file (#1967). A split
non-member child (#738) is normally auto-charged at its hold deadline to the
member's saved card inherited from the parent payment
(`savedPaymentMethodForBooking`). But a `PAYMENT_PENDING` parent can legitimately
pay by **Internet Banking** (switch-at-pay flips the parent to `CONFIRMED` with
an IB-source payment), which leaves the parent payment with no
`stripeCustomerId`/`stripePaymentMethodId` — so the child resolves to no saved
card and is not `originBookingRequest`. Rather than stranding the guests (the old
`missing_payment_method` path only logged), `cron-confirm-pending.ts` now mirrors
the #707 request-origin path — but only for a **genuine split child whose parent
is genuinely settled without a card** (an IB-source payment on a live parent, or
a parent already `CONFIRMED`/`PAID`/`COMPLETED`). #796 group joiners also carry
`parentBookingId` but always have a `GroupBookingJoin` row written atomically at
creation; that row is the discriminator, and joiners keep the pre-existing
`missing_payment_method` log path. When the gate passes the cron extends the
hold, mints a tokenised `/pay/<token>` PaymentLink (reusing the #707 machinery)
so the member can settle the guest portion, and emails the member that link.
The **member email fires once per mint** — `mintSplitGuestPaymentLinkIfAbsent`
is guarded on the absence of an active (unrevoked, unused, unexpired)
PaymentLink for the child — while the **admin alert
(`sendAdminSplitSettlementUnpaidAlert`) follows a derived cadence** (#1993 Part
B): it fires on hold-extension windows 1, 2 and 3, then every 7th window
thereafter, capping the previously-uncapped ~2-daily alert. The window number is
a pure function of elapsed time — `floor((now − originalHoldExpiry) /
REQUEST_HOLD_EXTENSION_MS) + 1`, where `originalHoldExpiry` is re-derived (no
schema, no counter) as `max(checkIn − holdDays, createdAt)` — and the upstream
extension CAS still fires exactly once per ~2-day window, so a cron rerun in the
same window never re-alerts. If the parent is NOT settled (e.g. an abandoned-card
`PAYMENT_PENDING` parent), no link is minted or emailed — the guest portion must
not settle ahead of the member's own place — and the same capped admin alert
fires with parent-unpaid wording instead.

Payment-link recovery and supersession (#1967). Raw tokens are never stored, so
a minted-but-undelivered link would otherwise stall settlement forever behind
the active-link sentinel. Recovery is revoke-and-remint: (a) if the cron's
post-commit member email throws or is suppressed, the cron revokes the
just-minted link **by row id** (never the whole booking, so a newer concurrent
link survives) and the next extension run re-mints and re-sends; (b) the
on-demand button (`POST /api/bookings/[id]/send-guest-payment-link` →
`issueSplitGuestPaymentLink`) is a true send/RE-SEND — it revokes the existing
active link and mints+emails a fresh one atomically under the per-lodge
advisory lock, except that an active link minted within the last minute
short-circuits as just-sent (the double-click guard); (c) an EXPIRED link is
not active (matching #707's `expired_payable` re-issue convention), so a child
whose dates moved out after its link lapsed gets a fresh link, while a child
whose check-in day has already ended never gets one minted at all. Every mint
site (cron, button, `/pay` re-issue) revokes-then-creates under the per-lodge
advisory lock, so at most one live token can exist per booking. Conversely,
once a saved card appears (e.g. the member later pays the parent by card), the
cron's auto-charge claim revokes the child's active links inside the claim
transaction and the `/pay` intent path re-reads the link under the same lock —
the tokenised link and the saved-card charge are never both live. The on-demand
issue path refuses (`not_payable`) whenever a saved card exists for the same
reason.

Reachable composite states (#1967): the parent and child settle independently,
so a child can be PAID while its parent is still unpaid (IB transfer never
reconciled) or after the parent is CANCELLED — the parent-cancel sweep
(`cancelLinkedProvisionalChildBookings`) only cancels children still PENDING
(and revokes their links); an already-PAID child deliberately survives, exactly
like any other paid booking (captured-money invariant), and needs the ordinary
cancel/refund flow if the party is not coming.

Terminal state at check-in (#1993 Part A, owner-selected Option 1). A split
child still `PENDING` (unsettled, no saved card) once its check-in day has ended
is **auto-cancelled** by the settlement cron: `PENDING -> CANCELLED`. The boundary
is the same one the link-mint stop uses — literally the same function,
`paymentLinkExpiryForCheckIn(checkIn, clubZone) <= now` (#2870), rather than the
same expression written out twice — so the two can never disagree about
"check-in has passed". The day ends in the club's **persisted** timezone
(`INV-CONFIG-002`), read once per cron run outside every transaction and threaded
in, because resolving it is a settings query and this decision runs under both
the global and the per-lodge advisory lock. Because the child holds no capacity this is
bookkeeping + notification, not a capacity change: under the per-lodge lock a
guarded `updateMany({ status: PENDING } -> CANCELLED)` CAS (count 0 => a payment
won the lock seconds earlier — `already_processed`, safe), then bed reconcile and
payment-link revocation, in the same transaction. Post-commit (outside the tx,
per `booking-events.ts` — an in-tx narrative INSERT failure would abort the whole
transaction and block the cancel) the `CANCELLED` booking event is recorded, the
member gets a **dedicated** guest-portion-cancelled email
(`split-guest-portion-cancelled`: nothing was ever charged, their own booking is
untouched — and it only promises "remains confirmed" when the parent is genuinely
settled), and admins get ONE **dedicated** terminal notice
(`sendAdminSplitSettlementCancelledAlert` / the `admin-split-settlement-cancelled`
template — its own registry entry, so an override or mute of the recurring
`admin-split-settlement-unpaid` alert cannot rewrite or suppress it). The recurring
alert itself now fires on a capped cadence (hold-extension windows 1, 2, 3, then
every 7th) and the terminal cancel ends that series. A **PAID child is never reached** (it is
not `PENDING`); the **parent is never touched**; and there is **no Xero void** —
an unsettled child never had an invoice. A split child that DOES have a saved
card is still auto-charged at its hold deadline as before (that path settles it,
so the terminal cancel is only for the no-card link path). The child otherwise
stays PENDING and holds no capacity throughout; if the lodge fills first, the
capacity re-check bumps it and revokes its link like any other provisional child.
Paying the parent by card instead keeps the automatic saved-card settlement path
unchanged.

Terminal state at check-in for request-origin holds (#2012, the #1993 sibling).
A request-origin booking (`originBookingRequest` set, request `CONVERTED`) still
`PENDING` with no saved card once its check-in day has ended is likewise
**auto-cancelled** by the settlement cron under the same boundary and the same
per-lodge-lock + guarded `PENDING -> CANCELLED` CAS discipline (count 0 => a
`/pay` settlement won — `already_processed`, zero side effects). The structural
difference from the split child: a request booking **holds real capacity**, so
the in-transaction bed reconcile genuinely RELEASES beds (mirroring the `bumped`
path), promo redemptions are cleaned up, and the post-commit waitlist wake has
real freed capacity to offer. The `CONVERTED` request row is deliberately left
as the historical record — the booking's CANCELLED status is the capacity source
of truth (a CONVERTED request is not declinable, so the decline flow cannot and
does not run here). Post-commit the requester gets a **dedicated**
`booking-request-payment-expired` email (no payment link — it is dead past
check-in; the path back is a new request) and admins get ONE dedicated
`admin-booking-request-hold-cancelled` notice with its own registry entry
(independently mutable/overridable from the recurring hold alert). The recurring
request-hold alert now follows the same capped cadence (extension windows 1, 2,
3, then every 7th), and the terminal cancel ends the series. A booking whose
parent request path acquired a saved card still auto-charges as before; `$0`
request bookings still auto-confirm.

Lodge check-in gate (F27 / #1372 + #1422) — status-preserving. A booking that
carries a pending admin review (`requiresAdminReview` true and
`adminReviewStatus = PENDING`) is BLOCKED from lodge check-in, but the block
never changes the booking's status. The canonical case is a paid booking edited
down to only under-18 guests (no adult): it stays PAID (captured-money
invariant, #1100) yet cannot arrive until an admin clears the review. The block
is reason-agnostic (#1422): any pending admin review gates check-in — today
adult-supervision is the only such reason, but a future review type inherits the
gate automatically. Enforcement is a single shared where-fragment
(`checkinNotBlockedByPendingReviewFilter` in `src/lib/booking-review.ts`) applied
to the arrive/depart and roster generate/confirm queries — since #2622 the roster
side is one shared query (`getOperationalRosterGuestsForDate` in
`src/lib/roster-eligibility.ts`) rather than a copy per surface, so the admin
roster and the hut-leader wizard cannot drift on who is blocked — so a blocked
booking's guest resolves to null server-side (arrive returns 404, roster-confirm 400) — the
block is safe because every lodge query already restricts to the operational
stay statuses (PAID/COMPLETED), so no parked `AWAITING_REVIEW` booking is
over-blocked. The lodge guest list (the check-in roster staff read on the kiosk)
INCLUDES the blocked booking but flags it "Blocked from Check-In — see Booking
Officer" and disables its arrival toggle — shown, not hidden, yet still
un-arrivable server-side (defense in depth). The check-in reminder cron skips
blocked bookings, and the review-required admin alert fires on its own
notification preference so muting routine new-booking alerts does not silence it.

To verify in later review: exact terminal transitions, non-member hold expiry,
school group `CONFIRMED` semantics, and payment-failure back paths.

Organiser-pays group children add one cron-driven back path: the
`group-settlement-reaper` reverts CONFIRMED-unpaid children to
`PAYMENT_PENDING` when the settlement expires, and cancels those reverted
children (`PAYMENT_PENDING -> CANCELLED`, #1094) if the settlement is still
FAILED after a second full window — a settlement retry always wins.

The same cron also resumes an organiser-cancel group cleanup interrupted by a
crash (#1236). Cancelling the organiser booking is single-flight, so a
re-invoked cancel 409s and never re-enters the joiner cleanup. Group cleanup now
persists `GroupBooking.CANCELLED` first under the settlement lock as its durable
settlement fence, then performs provider work outside the transaction; a third
reaper phase therefore re-drives any ORGANISER_PAYS group under a `CANCELLED`
organiser booking that still has active organiser-settled children after the
short grace (regardless of the already-fenced group status). The re-drive is
idempotent because the first run persists the per-child refund plan
(`{childId: cents}`) on the settlement **before** the Stripe refund and
**before** the settlement flips to `REFUNDED`/`PARTIALLY_REFUNDED`: a re-drive
reconstructs that plan verbatim (never recomputes — a >24h re-drive can land in
a different cancellation tier) and applies the per-child `refundedAmountCents`
mirror, and the `SUCCEEDED` guard plus the Stripe idempotency key fire the
refund at most once. Each child's Xero refund credit-note outbox row is enqueued
**inside the same transaction** as that child's cancel + refund mirror
(#1257/#1377), so a crash can never leave a `CANCELLED` child with its mirror
written but no credit-note operation queued — durable for every source,
including Internet-Banking children the #1354 self-heal cannot recover. Only the
outbox worker kick stays best-effort and post-commit.

Internet Banking settlement initiation writes `GroupBookingSettlement.PENDING`
and its Xero invoice outbox operation in the same transaction. The worker checks
the group fence under `lock(1)` before calling Xero. If cancellation is already
durable it completes without creating an invoice; if cancellation commits while
`createInvoices` is in flight, the worker persists the returned Xero identity,
voids it under a stable idempotency key, suppresses invoice email, and leaves a
failed compensation retryable through the same outbox row.

A transient Stripe failure during that settlement refund no longer abandons it
(#1351, owner-decided durable auto-retry). A recovery operation is persisted
**before** the inline refund (closed on the happy path) and the frozen plan is
kept, never nulled: the payment-recovery cron replays the refund under the
same `group_cancel_refund_<settlementId>` Stripe key — so an ambiguous failure
where Stripe actually refunded is replayed, not repeated — flips the
settlement, applies the per-child `refundedAmountCents` mirrors idempotently
(only to already-`CANCELLED` plan children whose mirror is still zero; ACTIVE
children stay owned by the reaper resume path), and enqueues the per-child
Xero credit notes. Admins are alerted only when the retries exhaust, and the
stuck-state dashboard flags any `SUCCEEDED` settlement under a `CANCELLED`
group whose refund plan has not executed.

Booking quote and create paths reject a linked member who is already present on
another live booking for any requested lodge night. The guard covers draft,
pending, confirmed/paid/completed, waitlist, offered, and admin-review bookings,
but does not change capacity-holding status rules. A member can open their own
conflicting booking, and a linked guest can remove only themselves from another
future booking when they are not the last guest.

Cancelling a paid booking is single-flight (#1160). The refund plan is frozen
from a re-read taken under the global booking advisory lock, and the status
flips to `CANCELLED` atomically with the credit-path ledger writes (refund
allocation + cancellation credit) — or, on the card path, with the durable
refund-recovery operation carrying the per-transaction allocation frozen from
that same locked read (#1349) — inside that same transaction. A concurrent
cancel or a retry that loses the claim re-reads the already-cancelled booking
and returns HTTP 409 without moving any money — no description-string
idempotency guard is needed because the claim itself guarantees the credit
writers run exactly once. Stripe/Xero work runs only after the claim commits.
Because the card-refund debt is persisted *before* the inline Stripe call, a
process death anywhere between the claim commit and the refund leaves a
`PENDING` recovery operation the payment-recovery cron replays — not a
silently lost refund (the pre-#1349 catch-only enqueue recorded the debt only
if the refund *threw*). The inline refund executes the operation's frozen
slices and marks it `SUCCEEDED` on completion; inline and cron therefore mint
identical `booking_cancel_refund_<bookingId>` Stripe idempotency keys **and send
a byte-identical request body** (#1494) — both build the refund metadata from
the shared `buildBookingCancellationRefundMetadata` helper
(`{ bookingId, reason: "cancellation" }`, deliberately carrying no
per-cancellation value the cron cannot reconstruct from the persisted
operation), so a Stripe-succeeded-but-unrecorded refund (or a cron tick racing
the inline call) is replayed by Stripe, never repeated and never rejected as an
`idempotency_error` for a reused key with mismatched parameters. An outstanding additional
PaymentIntent is retired durably (#1350): the claim transaction persists a
`CANCEL_PAYMENT_INTENT` recovery operation alongside the FAILED flip, the
Phase-2 inline Stripe cancel stays best-effort (logged, never allowed to
abort the committed claim), and the recovery cron finishes the job — a
still-cancellable intent is cancelled, while one Stripe already captured is
handed off to a full refund. A capture that races the webhook is caught
twice over: the `payment_intent.succeeded` superseded-intent hook routes
intents with a cancellation-recovery row straight to refund recovery, and the
`modification_additional` handler status-guards CANCELLED bookings — the
capture is recorded truthfully, refunded in full under the idempotent
`late_cancel_refund_<bookingId>_<intentId>` key, alerted to admins, and the
supplementary Xero invoice is never released (a race that already released it
gets a delta-capped corrective refund credit note instead). As a backstop
detector, the admin stuck-state dashboard flags recent `CANCELLED` bookings
whose captured payment shows no recorded refund, no recovery operation, and
no cancellation narrative event — the crash-window signature that previously
fired nothing.

Cancelling a no-payment booking (`WAITLISTED`, `WAITLIST_OFFERED`,
`AWAITING_REVIEW`) is likewise status-guarded claim-first under the SAME global
booking advisory lock (#1311). This path takes no Stripe/Xero call, so the only
hazard is a state clobber, not a double money-move: a held `AWAITING_REVIEW`
booking can be converted to `PENDING` by a concurrent quote-accept, which holds
that lock and re-writes the held booking by id only. The cancel therefore takes
the same lock, re-reads the status under it, and flips to `CANCELLED` only while
the status is still one of the three no-payment states; if a concurrent accept
(or another cancel) has moved it out of that set the loser returns HTTP 409 and
runs no side effects (no status flip, pointer detach, bed reconcile, audit,
email, or waitlist re-process), so a just-accepted booking is never clobbered
back to `CANCELLED`.

The linked provisional-child sweep triggered by a successful parent cancel is
also claim-first (#1881 residual). A pre-lock `PENDING` child is only a
candidate: cancellation takes global `lock(1)`, then that child's per-lodge
capacity lock, re-reads it, and conditionally claims `PENDING -> CANCELLED`.
The hold-resolution cron shares the per-lodge lock. If it has already confirmed
or charged the child, cancellation loses the claim and emits no stale bed,
credit, payment-link, audit, event, email, promo, or waitlist side effect.

That under-lock re-guard catches an accept committing AFTER the cancel's
under-lock read, but the cancel *dispatches its branch* from an earlier OUTER,
un-locked read. So the two callers that exist to release a held request — the
admin **Release hold** route and the decline path — pass a `requireRequestHold`
flag: if that outer read already shows the hold has left `AWAITING_REVIEW` (e.g.
a concurrent quote-accept flipped it to `PENDING`), the cancel refuses with HTTP
409 and takes no side effect, rather than dispatching into the generic `PENDING`
cancel branch and cancelling the just-accepted booking / revoking its brand-new
payment links (#1406). The two guards close the race together: the flag covers
an accept that commits before the outer read, the under-lock re-read covers one
that commits after it. Callers cancelling a genuine member-created `PENDING`
booking (member self-cancel, account-deletion cleanup) never set the flag and
are unaffected.

Every cancel path restores previously applied account credit (#1547) — all
`cancelBooking` branches plus the Internet-Banking hold-expiry release
(`internet-banking-payment-cron.ts`), the one automatic cancel outside
`cancelBooking`. A member can apply account credit to a booking (a negative
`BOOKING_APPLIED` ledger row); if the booking is then cancelled that row MUST
be reversed or the credit is silently lost. The paid path restores the applied slice at the
cancellation tier (#1164). The never-captured / no-refund path
(`PAYMENT_PENDING`/`CONFIRMED`/`PAID` with no paid-path payment) and the
`PENDING` and no-payment paths restore it at **100%** — nothing was captured, so
no cancellation-policy tiering applies (the same capacity-failure system-void
precedent). To make that restore exactly-once, the never-captured branch and the
generic `PENDING` branch are now themselves status-guarded claim-first under the
same booking advisory lock (previously the `PENDING` branch was unlocked with no
status re-guard); `restoreCreditFromBooking` carries no internal replay guard, so
each branch's atomic status flip is its only idempotency guarantee. A CANCELLED
booking may legitimately hold consumed credit with no restore row ONLY when its
payment captured money (0%-tier paid cancels write no restore row; held-as-credit
refunds keep the applied rows) or settled without cash (the fully-credit-covered
$0 SUCCEEDED payment, whose cancel takes the paid path and may tier the restore
to 0). The daily credit-reconciliation cron alerts
(alert-only, no auto-heal — a post-fix hit is a new regression) on any CANCELLED
booking still holding orphaned applied credit, and
`scripts/backfill-orphaned-applied-credits.ts` heals pre-fix orphans.

### BookingEvent Scope

`BookingEvent` is a durable narrative fact store, not the complete transition
ledger. It stores the facts needed to explain member/admin-visible events such
as creation, payment, bumping, cancellation, refund, and credit outcomes after
AuditLog retention pruning.

Transitions that do not need a narrative fact remain durable through their
own state fields or operational ledgers. For example, waitlist offers and
expiries use booking waitlist fields plus waitlist/audit records, admin review
and force-confirm actions use booking status/admin review fields plus AuditLog,
scheduled completion uses booking status plus CronJobRun, and money/provider
work uses payment, transaction, refund, recovery, and Xero outbox ledgers.

Admin force-confirm records are written in the same transaction as the booking
status change. Explicit overbook overrides use the
`waitlist.force_confirmed_overbook` action with critical severity, preserved
retention, overbooked date-only nights, and an admin waitlist completion report
linking directly to the filtered audit record.

The admin `PAYMENT_PENDING -> WAITLISTED` repair (#2649) is recorded the same
way: `waitlist.returned_to_waitlist`, `booking` category, written with the
booking status change in one transaction, and carrying the id of the
`waitlist.confirm_offer_release_failed` row it resolves so the strand and its
repair link in both directions. It is offered only where that row exists and is
unresolved — the booking's own columns retain no waitlist provenance, and the
free / `PAYMENT_PENDING` / no-payment-record shape is reached by several
ordinary paths that were never on a waitlist. Of the four conditions, the two
scalar ones (`status: PAYMENT_PENDING` and `finalPriceCents: 0`) are re-asserted
inside the guarded `updateMany`; the absence of a `Payment` row and the strand
report are read under the same two locks immediately above it.

## Booking Modification Lifecycle

Known change request statuses: `REQUESTED`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, and — for a
`POLICY_EXCEPTION`-kind request only — `CANCELLED` and `SUPERSEDED` (#2365) plus
`EXPIRED` (#2553, written by the hold-reaper cron). This sentence is the status
census: a narrowed type or filter list copied from it must carry all six.

```text
member/admin starts edit -> quoted delta -> local booking mutation
positive delta -> additional payment or supplementary Xero invoice
uncollected additional payment -> reminder at +3 days, reminder 2 days before
  check-in, admin re-send on demand; stops at check-out (never auto-cancelled)
negative delta -> Stripe refund or source-linked member credit
admin review path -> REQUESTED -> APPROVED or REJECTED
```

**Booking-policy exception requests (#2365).** A `BookingChangeRequest` now
carries a `kind`: the original today/past-night edit is `LOCKED_PERIOD`, and a
member request to override an eligible *soft* booking-policy failure (a
minimum-stay rule or the adult-member hosting requirement — the #2363 allowlist,
never a hard limit) is `POLICY_EXCEPTION`. A policy-exception row freezes the
complete immutable proposal (`proposalSnapshot` + its SHA-256 `proposalHash`),
the structured evidence it asks an admin to allow (`frozenEvidence`, the #2363
HOLD-if-any-HOLD aggregate) plus the denormalised `aggregateCapacityMode`, a
required `memberMessage` (trimmed, <=1000 chars), and attempt/conflict metadata
(`attemptCount`, `conflictCount`, `lastConflictAt`, `lastConflictReason`). Its
lifecycle adds three terminal outcomes to the shared enum (`CANCELLED` and
`SUPERSEDED` with #2365, `EXPIRED` with #2553):

```text
POLICY_EXCEPTION request -> REQUESTED
  REQUESTED -> APPROVED   (Booking Officer allows the exact reviewed proposal;
                           atomic canonical execution — see the follow-up lane)
  REQUESTED -> REJECTED   (declined)
  REQUESTED -> CANCELLED  (member withdrew the proposal before a decision)
  REQUESTED -> SUPERSEDED (a newer proposal, or live-booking drift, replaced it)
  REQUESTED -> EXPIRED    (#2553: nobody decided it before its capacity hold's
                           deadline, so the reaper cron released the beds)
```

Every non-`REQUESTED` state is terminal (a guarded `updateMany` on
`status = REQUESTED` plus the integer `version` token enforces the single
transition, exactly the `BookingRequest.version` discipline, #1923). A held
request does NOT change its live booking; a held modification request reserves
only the incremental per-night capacity beyond the unchanged live booking. The
reservation ledger keys to a `BookingChangeRequest`, so new-booking requests (the
separate `NewBookingPolicyExceptionRequest` store) do not yet hold a provisional
reservation — their approval rechecks capacity instead — until the new-booking
hold lands with the Booking Officer approval screen (#2526).

**The provisional-reservation and atomic approve-and-execute lane is built
(#2525).** Each held request materialises its footprint as
`PolicyExceptionReservationNight` rows that the canonical capacity calculation
counts as occupancy, so a pending request cannot be oversold. The four
releasing transitions — `REJECTED`, `CANCELLED`, `SUPERSEDED`, `EXPIRED` — delete
those rows in the SAME guarded transaction that writes the status, under the
global -> per-lodge lock order: the member-owned CANCELLED and SUPERSEDED in
`booking-exception-request-service.ts`, and the officer REJECTED plus the reaper's
EXPIRED in `resolvePolicyExceptionRequestTerminal`
(`booking-exception-execution.ts`). A lost claim releases nothing.
`REQUESTED -> APPROVED` is different: it does
not "release then create". Inside ONE transaction the approval reauthorizes from
fresh DB roles, re-reads under the global -> per-lodge locks, re-checks the
proposal hash and `classifyPolicyExceptionDrift` (a disappeared reviewed rule
executes WITHOUT an override; a materially-changed or new violation keeps the
request `REQUESTED` for resubmission), rechecks capacity for a NO_HOLD aggregate
(a conflict keeps it `REQUESTED` with a recorded reason rather than failing it),
claims `REQUESTED -> APPROVED` with the `version` CAS, releases the reservation,
and invokes the now transaction-aware canonical booking service
(`createConfirmedBooking` / `modifyBookingBatch`) so the reserved beds become the
executed booking's own beds with no mark-approved-then-call-service gap. Provider
work and the member approval/rejection notice run after commit. See
`docs/CONCURRENCY_AND_LOCKING.md` -> "Provisional reservations for held
policy-exception requests".

**An abandoned hold expires (#2553).** A request nobody ever decides used to hold
its beds forever. Every request that actually reserves beds is therefore stamped
at creation with an immutable `holdExpiresAt`: seven days
(`POLICY_EXCEPTION_HOLD_TTL_DAYS`), never past the start of the first night it is
holding, and never less than 24 hours
(`POLICY_EXCEPTION_HOLD_MIN_TTL_HOURS`) so a late request still gets a real
review window. The deadline is stamped once and never rewritten, so a member's
expiry date cannot move under them. The `policy-exception-hold-reaper` cron
(`src/lib/cron-policy-exception-hold-reaper.ts`, every 3 hours in the general
cycle) then closes each past-deadline hold through
`resolvePolicyExceptionRequestTerminal` with `to: "EXPIRED"` — the SAME guarded
claim and atomic release the other three terminal outcomes use, so there is no
second release implementation to drift. Three things bound it: it only scans
`REQUESTED` + `POLICY_EXCEPTION` + `HOLD`-aggregate rows that still have live
`PolicyExceptionReservationNight` rows, so a request stranding no capacity (a
`NO_HOLD` aggregate, or a HOLD aggregate whose incremental footprint came out
empty) is never closed by a cron; the `version` CAS means a decision landing in
the same window wins and the reaper releases nothing; and a past-deadline row the
shared transition refuses outright (not a policy-exception row, or an unparsable
`proposalSnapshot`) is counted as `unresolvable` and logged at warn, because
unlike a lost claim it can never self-heal. Each expiry leaves three records: the
`EXPIRED` status the member and officer surfaces read, a
`booking-policy-exception-request.expired` audit row, and a
`policy-exception-request-expired` courtesy email to the member who raised it.
Both side effects run strictly AFTER the release commits and neither can affect
it — a failed audit write or a bounced email is logged and swallowed, so it can
never roll back a release, re-run one, or stop the reaper closing the run's other
holds. The member's one-open-request slot is freed, so a lapse never locks them
out of raising a fresh proposal.

**Member request surfaces (#2524, wired to #2525).** #2524 builds the
request-CREATION half of that flow (creation, member cancel, member supersede, the
officer queue read and the on-request notification). Integrated with #2525, that
same service now HOLDS the incremental provisional reservation for a held
modification and RELEASES it atomically on member cancel / supersede; the officer
approval + reject half is the #2525 execution engine, assembled behind the Booking
Officer approval route (#2526). Because a
`BookingChangeRequest.bookingId` is a required FK, a NEW booking has no row to
attach to, so new-booking proposals get their own dedicated store,
`NewBookingPolicyExceptionRequest`, sharing the same `BookingChangeRequestStatus`
lifecycle, the same immutable proposal/hash + frozen-evidence + `memberMessage`
discipline, and the same integer `version` claim token. A MODIFICATION request
stays on the `POLICY_EXCEPTION` `BookingChangeRequest` above. Both enforce a
**one-open-request rule race-safely at the database**: a `REQUESTED` row holds a
deterministic `openStateKey` slot (`nbpe:{memberId}:{proposalHash}` for a new
booking, `pe:{bookingId}:{memberId}` for a modification) under a NULL-distinct
unique index, and every terminal transition NULLs it — so a losing concurrent
create races into a unique violation (mapped to 409) rather than a second open
row, and a `LOCKED_PERIOD` row (which never sets the slot) is unaffected. Cancel
and supersede are the guarded single transitions above; a supersede that loses
its `REQUESTED -> SUPERSEDED` claim creates NO replacement. The Booking Officer
queue read merges both stores into one age-ordered view.

**The officer decision is wired (#2526).** The Booking Officer's queue is a
dedicated *Policy Exceptions* tab on Booking Requests, and
`PATCH /api/admin/booking-exception-requests/[id]` is the decision. Approving is
NOT a status flip: the route assembles the real #2525 hooks
(`src/lib/booking-exception-approval.ts`) and the engine claims the request AND
runs the canonical booking service in the same transaction, so the request
becomes APPROVED only if the booking was really created or really changed. Every
other outcome leaves the row exactly as it was and is reported as such — a
capacity conflict answers "still pending", never "approved". Because the engine
now takes a `PolicyExceptionRequestStore`, the SAME algorithm decides both
tables; the new-booking store's reservation release is a no-op, since a
new-booking request holds no beds while it waits.

```text
officer decision (both stores)
  approve + confirm -> executed            (booking created / change applied)
                       + followUpFailed    (committed; post-commit work threw)
                    -> claimLost           (409: the queue was stale)
                    -> notAuthorized       (403: fresh-DB roles refuse)
                    -> proposalDrift       (409: live booking or delta moved)
                    -> proposalUnreplayable(409: pre-format row; booking unmoved)
                    -> policyDrift         (409: a reviewed rule materially changed)
                    -> keptPendingCapacity (409: still REQUESTED, conflict recorded)
                    -> needsSettlementMethod (400: price drops, no refund choice)
                    -> guest refusal       (403/400: the party is not bookable)
  refuse + reason   -> REJECTED            (reservation released atomically)
```

`executed` is terminal even when `followUpFailed` is set: the transaction has
committed, so the request IS `APPROVED` and the booking IS real. Only the
post-commit phase (provider hand-offs, audit rows, the member email) failed, and
the officer is told exactly that rather than being told the request is still
pending — a "pending" answer after a commit is the one thing this state machine
must never produce.

Where the capacity recheck runs depends on whether the store's held requests
actually reserve beds (`holdsReservation`). A modification request holds an
incremental reservation, so its recheck runs AFTER the release (its own beds must
not count against it) and its conflict is recorded in a separate transaction,
because the signal that keeps it `REQUESTED` rolls the approval transaction back.
A new-booking request holds nothing, so it is rechecked BEFORE the claim and its
conflict commits in the one transaction that commits. Either way
`conflictCount` / `lastConflictAt` / `lastConflictReason` are written, which is
what lets both the officer's card and the member's own list say "the lodge is
full" rather than showing a silent `REQUESTED`.

**The member's own view of that lifecycle (#2562).** The member-facing request
area does not add a state; it PROJECTS the stored ones, and the projection is a
pure function in `src/lib/member-exception-requests.ts` shared by every member
surface, so there is only one place a status can be turned into a word. Six stored
statuses become seven member-visible ones, because `REQUESTED` splits in two:

```text
REQUESTED, no conflict recorded  -> pending
                                    ("With the Booking Officer")
REQUESTED, lastConflictAt set    -> pending-capacity-conflict
                                    ("Waiting - the lodge was full")
APPROVED                         -> approved   ("Approved and booked")
REJECTED                         -> refused    ("Not approved")
CANCELLED                        -> withdrawn  ("Withdrawn by you")
SUPERSEDED                       -> superseded ("Replaced by a newer request")
EXPIRED                          -> expired    ("Lapsed")
```

The split is the point, not a nicety: a request an officer has already tried to
apply and the lodge stopped is a materially different thing to tell somebody than
a request nobody has opened, and collapsing them reads as "nobody has looked" — a
statement the member would act on. A conflict counts as live only while the row is
still `REQUESTED`; once it is decided, withdrawn, replaced, expired or executed, an
old conflict is history and stops colouring the row. The mapping is exhaustive over
the Prisma enum (a `never` assignment), so a status added later cannot default into
a friendly word.

Two derived facts travel with each row and are deliberately NOT restatements of the
status. `capacityHeld` is read from the reservation ledger, never from
`aggregateCapacityMode` — false for every new-booking request whatever its mode
says, and false for a modification whose incremental footprint came out empty (a
pure shrink) — and `canWithdraw` / `canReplace` are derived from the very condition
the cancel and supersede services' guarded claims name (`status = REQUESTED`), so
the UI cannot offer an action the API would answer with a 409. A replacement is a
new frozen proposal reached through the wizard that built the original, not an edit
of the stored one: the officer decides the exact proposal that was frozen.

Edit-eligibility is governed by a date-window edit policy
(`getBookingEditPolicy`), whose `mode` selects what a request may change:

```text
checkIn > today                     -> "future"        (edit dates/guests freely)
checkIn <= today <= checkOut        -> "in-progress"   (extend future nights only;
                                                         check-in locked; #2029:
                                                         the whole check-out day
                                                         is still editable)
checkOut < today                    -> null            (not self-editable)

adminOverride && role === "ADMIN"   -> "admin-override" (issue #1668: date-window
                                                         locks lifted; status
                                                         eligibility + capacity
                                                         lock still enforced)
```

In `"in-progress"` mode the plan that prices the change
(`buildInProgressGuestRangePlan`) works from each guest's canonical
`BookingGuestNight` set, not from their `stayStart`/`stayEnd` envelope
(#2736, `INV-MOD-025`). A guest with a gap in their stay keeps the gap: it is
not charged, not written back as a night row and not given a bed, while an
extension still buys contiguous new nights after their last held one. The edit
also sells only the nights it creates (#2743): a night is added to an existing
guest only when the check-out actually moves, and only past the OLD check-out,
so an edit that leaves the dates alone — a guest added or removed, a promo or
member-link change — cannot add a night to anybody. (A name-only edit never
reaches this plan: it is identity-only on both routes and takes the
price-preserving echo.) The discriminator is whether a guest's held nights reach
the BOOKING'S own check-out, not whether they have gone home, so a guest who is
in the lodge tonight but leaves before the booking does gets the same gap and the
same smaller bill as one who left a week ago. Extending the check-out does still
admit every remaining guest for the nights it adds — this plan overrides
`guestStayRanges` for existing guests and the panel offers no per-guest end date
on an in-progress edit, so an API caller that sends one is ignored rather than
refused, and the officer sees the cost as one aggregate quote line for the whole
party. Because nobody is back-filled, a removal can leave `Booking.checkOut`
ahead of the last night anybody holds; that is accepted rather than guarded.
A night the edit gives back is credited at the price the member paid rather than
at today's season rate, and the per-night rows written back are each night's real
rate rather than the guest's average (#2744, `INV-MOD-025`); a guest with no
recoverable stored price is still valued at today's rate, capped so that no edit
can credit back more than that guest is carrying.
For an ordinary stay that runs to the booking's check-out, every number is
exactly what it was before. Bookings edited before those fixes keep the rows and
the price they were given — history is not repriced (#2745 carries the decision
about whether anything is done about them). Two edits are newly refused, both
because the booking would be left with NOBODY in the future window: a check-out
pulled back past the last night any remaining guest still holds, and a save on a
booking whose check-out is still ahead but whose guests have all finished their
stays. Both name a check-out the plan will actually accept — the suggestion is
clamped at the edit window, without which #2743's own shape would name a date
every guard rejects and the booking would be editable by no route at all. The last
money shape stated rather than fixed on this path is now fixed too (#2756): the
plan priced each guest on their own, so nights an in-progress edit newly BOUGHT
carried no group discount; it prices the whole party in one pass per window, and
a night the guest already holds is valued identically on both sides of the edit so
nothing already bought moves — see `INV-MOD-025`. The same change fixed a wider
fault behind it: every edit path built its season data without the season's `type`,
so on the DEFAULT summer-only setting no edit of any kind could qualify for the
discount, whichever planner ran. Season loading now goes through the one
`toSeasonRateData` mapper, which is a price change to ordinary edits as well —
see `INV-MOD-006`.

Because that price change reaches a club on the default setting, the club now has
a say in it (#2770). `GroupDiscountSetting.applyToEdits` decides whether a booking
edited later earns the group discount on the nights that edit newly buys, and it
governs this planner exactly as it governs the ordinary one: both
`calculateModifiedPricing` and the modify-quote route read the setting once and
hand the SAME resolved value to `buildInProgressGuestRangePlan` and to the
ordinary pricing pass, so the two branches cannot price a night differently. The
default is on, which is what every edit path already did, so no club's prices move
because the switch exists; switched off, the nights an edit buys price exactly as
they would at a club with no group discount at all, and nights a guest already
holds keep their stored price in either state — see `INV-MOD-026`.

Self-service cancellation of a **started** stay is blocked (#2029). Once
`checkIn <= todayNZ`, the member-facing cancel route
(`enforceStartedStayBlock`) refuses cancellation for a booking owner or Booking
Officer with a clear "edit to shorten your remaining nights, or contact the
club" message; a Full Admin (`sessionUserRole === "ADMIN"`) keeps full
cancellation capability, and every internal/admin cancel path (decline,
release-hold, review-reject, account-deletion) is unaffected. This restores the
invariant that a started stay is not member-cancellable — previously implicit
because the completion cron flipped a started PAID booking to the
non-cancellable COMPLETED state on day one, an implicit guard #2029's widened
PAID window removed. Leaving early is done by shrinking the remaining future
nights through the in-progress edit path (policy-retained), never an
irreversible `PAID -> CANCELLED` that releases beds with guests present.

The admin-override mode is date-only and takes one of two pricing modes:
`shift` (pure relocation, all cents frozen, night count preserved, no fee /
settlement / Stripe / Xero — a `BookingModification` of type `ADMIN_DATE_SHIFT`
with zero deltas) or `recalculate` (the standard reprice with locked-period
clamps lifted). An over-capacity override is warn-and-confirm: the first apply
raises `OverCapacityConfirmationRequiredError` (409,
`OVER_CAPACITY_CONFIRM_REQUIRED`) and only proceeds when resubmitted with
`confirmOverCapacity: true`, recording `capacityOverridden`. The same
warn-and-confirm contract covers **every admin on-behalf create** — past-dated
(#1695) and future-dated (#1767) — except a create that opted into the
waitlist fallback (which keeps the capacity-exceeded outcome so the
WAITLISTED booking is created instead); a member self-create keeps the hard
capacity block and can never overbook. (The former v1 hard block on a
non-member hold-eligible (PENDING) party was retired by #1771 — the persisted
override now lets the hold cron confirm rather than bump the overbook.) Every
override move is audited as `booking.modify.admin_override` (including the
admin's explicit member-notification choice, `notifyMember`) and linked,
best-effort, to the booking's most recent APPROVED-but-unlinked change request
that the move fulfils (date-only request whose named dates equal the applied
values).

**Persisted capacity override (#1771).** Every over-capacity admission stamps
`Booking.capacityOverriddenAt` + `capacityOverriddenByMemberId` (immutable, set
only when the override fires, never cleared on cancel). The payment-time and
settlement capacity re-checks — `markBookingPaymentSucceeded`, payment links,
`cron-confirm-pending`, `charge-saved-method`, `switch-to-internet-banking`, the
Internet Banking invoice-paid reconcile, and group settlement — now consult
`bookingHasCapacityOverride` and, when set, settle/advance the booking to its
correct terminal state (PAID / CONFIRMED / payment proceeds) instead of
cancelling+refunding, 409ing, or bumping it. Previously a *priced* overridden
booking self-destructed when payment landed over capacity; $0/credit-covered
overridden creates settled at create time and were never affected. The
DRAFT-scoped re-checks (`create-payment-intent`, `confirm-draft`) are exempt (a
DRAFT can never carry an override).

To verify: failed post-transaction refund recovery, Xero credit-note creation,
additional-payment cleanup, and bed-allocation reconciliation.

Cancelled-booking soft-delete is an admin cleanup state, not hard erasure. It
keeps the booking record and remains blocked by captured/refunded/credited
payment, refund, member-credit, payment-recovery, or Xero history. Internal
modification rows with positive and negative cent deltas may be soft-deleted
when those deltas net to zero and no external financial history exists. The
member-credit blocker follows the same net-zero rule (#1547, owner decision
2026-07-07): applied credit that was fully reversed (net-zero, only
`BOOKING_APPLIED`/`CANCELLATION_REFUND` rows, and no row carrying a Xero
credit-note id) no longer blocks — and the coincident `payment.creditAppliedCents`
mirror is waived with it — but an `ADMIN_ADJUSTMENT`/`BOOKING_MODIFICATION_REFUND`
row, a net-non-zero ledger, or any Xero-linked credit note still blocks, as does
any independently captured/refunded payment.

Soft-delete also reaches out to Stripe, **after** its transaction commits
(#2700, `INV-ADDPAY-036`). The blockers above count CAPTURED payment history, so
an intent that has not captured yet is exactly the state they permit — and
exactly the state that can capture a moment later, because deleting a booking
does not by itself touch Stripe. The delete therefore cancels the booking's
in-flight PaymentIntents, both the base one and the modification one, once the
booking row is durably deleted: outside the transaction so no provider round
trip is made while `pg_advisory_xact_lock(1)` is held, and never throwing, so a
Stripe outage cannot turn a completed deletion into an error the admin would
retry. The local `PaymentTransaction` is marked FAILED **only** when Stripe
confirms the cancel; `canceled: false` means the intent reached a terminal state
on its own — possibly `succeeded` — and writing FAILED there would be a lie.
A cancellation that fails is audited as
`booking.delete.payment_intent_cancel.failed` (`outcome: "failure"`) as well as
logged. This makes the race rare rather than impossible; a capture that still
lands is handled by the manual refund task lifecycle above.

## Public Booking Request Quote Lifecycle

A `BookingRequest` from the public form can be priced through one or more
`BookingRequestQuote` versions. Known quote statuses: `DRAFT`, `SENT`,
`ACCEPTED`, `CANCELLED`, `SUPERSEDED`.

```text
DRAFT -> SENT (admin sends; a SHA-256 response token is issued, time-limited; the
               beds are auto-held as an AWAITING_REVIEW booking, #1254)
SENT  -> ACCEPTED (requester accepts an option; booking conversion runs; the held
               booking stays capacity-holding until payment)
SENT  -> CANCELLED (requester cancels; the held booking is released and heldBookingId detached)
SENT  -> SUPERSEDED (requester asks a question / requests changes, or admin issues a newer quote;
               the hold is retained across a re-quote for the same dates, but if the request
               settles in MODIFICATION_REQUESTED / QUERY_PENDING with no outstanding quote the
               quote-expiry cron auto-releases the hold once the last response window lapses, #1254)
SENT  -> SUPERSEDED (admin DECLINES the request; the outstanding quote is retired in the SAME
               transaction as the DECLINED claim so no requester action or reminder cron can act
               on it — SUPERSEDED = admin retired it, distinct from a requester-cancel CANCELLED, #1423)
SENT  -> (link expires; the quote-expiry cron releases the held booking, frees the beds, and
          detaches heldBookingId — the request stays QUOTE_SENT so an admin can re-quote)
```

The whole quote lifecycle holds capacity (#1254). Sending a quote reserves the
beds/guest-nights before the send is finalized, so a quote is never emailed for
dates it cannot reserve: if the lodge is full the send fails with `409` and no
quote is marked SENT. The hold spans accept (the held row becomes the converted
PENDING booking and keeps holding, see the booking-status section above) and is
released on cancel, expiry, or a capacity-reduction bump (see the #1317 note in
the booking-status section above).

Decline and the hold (#1365, broadened #1423): the admin **decline** route
declines a request in any of the six held/editor states its status-guarded flip
claims — `VERIFIED`, `PRICED`, `QUOTED`, `QUOTE_SENT`, `QUERY_PENDING`,
`MODIFICATION_REQUESTED` (`DECLINABLE_BOOKING_REQUEST_STATUSES`). This is the same
set the admin panel shows the Decline button for, and every one can carry a live
`AWAITING_REVIEW` hold (a SCHOOL **manual** hold via `holdBookingRequestSlots`, or
the auto-hold-on-send #1280). A terminal/converted state
(`APPROVED`/`CONVERTED`/`DECLINED`/`CANCELLED`) or `NEW` is NOT in that set, so
decline `409`s and leaves any hold untouched. It runs **claim-first**: the
`DECLINED` flip happens FIRST, so a wrong-state decline never touches the held
booking; only AFTER the request is actually claimed does it release the hold via
the shared cancel path — cancelling the `AWAITING_REVIEW` held booking,
reconciling away its beds, and detaching `heldBookingId`, with the requester's
cancellation email suppressed (an admin decision, not a requester cancellation).
A held pointer that is stale or no longer a live `AWAITING_REVIEW` hold is simply
detached. SCHOOL requests use the same function (no type branch).

Because `QUOTE_SENT` (and other quote-bearing states) DO carry a live `SENT`
quote a requester could still act on, broadening decline reintroduces a
decline-vs-requester race. A DECLINED request is made untouchable by every other
actor:

- **Primary — retire the quote atomically with the claim.** The decline flips the
  outstanding `SENT` quote to `SUPERSEDED` in the SAME transaction as the
  `DECLINED` claim (and only when the claim actually landed, so a wrong-state
  decline still touches nothing). Since `loadSentQuoteByToken` requires
  `status === SENT`, this alone `409`s all four requester quote actions
  (accept / modify / query / cancel) on a still-live link, and makes the
  pre-expiry reminder cron — which selects only `SENT` quotes — skip the declined
  request instead of nudging it.
- **accept-wins-first:** the requester accept converts the held booking to a live
  `PENDING` booking before the decline runs. Decline passes `requireRequestHold:
  true` to the shared cancel path (#1406), which then refuses (`409`, no side
  effect) rather than clobber the just-converted booking.
- **decline-wins-first (defence-in-depth for a POST already past its token
  load):** the decline claims `DECLINED` and releases the hold first
  (`heldBookingId` detached, `convertedBookingId` still null). The concurrent
  requester's accept re-arm to `PRICED`, its modify/query re-status to
  `MODIFICATION_REQUESTED`/`QUERY_PENDING`, and the losing-accept capacity revert
  to `QUOTE_SENT` are each a **status-guarded** `updateMany` with `status notIn
  [DECLINED, CANCELLED]`. A late accept or modify/query `409`s (no new booking and
  no resurrection), and the revert simply does not un-decline the request. The
  guards deliberately still allow a re-arm from `CONVERTED`/`APPROVED` so approve's
  `convertedBookingId` idempotency replay (#1232 double-accept) keeps returning the
  one existing booking.
- **admin re-send (symmetric admin-side backstop, #1504):** the admin quote
  re-send (`sendBookingRequestQuote`) closes the same narrow TOCTOU on the admin
  side. Its flip to `QUOTE_SENT` is a **status-guarded** `updateMany` that claims
  the request only while it is still in a quoteable state (the same live set
  `holdBookingRequestSlots` requires), committed BEFORE the quote email. So an
  admin re-send racing a concurrent decline in the narrow window after the hold's
  own status check `409`s ("...has been declined or cancelled.") and delivers no
  email, instead of resurrecting the just-`DECLINED` request to `QUOTE_SENT`.

**Lock-ordering invariant (#1423):** every transaction that writes both a
`BookingRequest` row and its `BookingRequestQuote` row(s) — the decline claim +
quote retirement, quote create, quote send, and the requester cancel /
modify / query — must lock the `BookingRequest` row FIRST, then the quote row(s).
Decline is claim-first and cannot swap, so all the others match its order; a
mismatched order lets a concurrent decline deadlock them (Postgres `40P01`), which
would surface as an unhandled `500` instead of a clean `409`. Preserve this order
when editing these paths.

As of #1385 the manual **Hold slots** admin UI entry is hidden on the generic
(non-SCHOOL) quote flow: auto-hold-on-send (#1280) reserves the beds across the
whole quote lifecycle, so a separate manual hold there is redundant and confusing.
This **supersedes** the earlier #1317 stance that the manual hold was deliberately
kept for all flows — that "kept for all flows" position now applies to SCHOOL only.
The manual Hold slots button is retained ONLY for SCHOOL requests, where it stays
meaningful: a school can be approved DIRECTLY without a sent quote and school
approval reuses the held booking (#1352), so the admin may need to reserve
capacity before that direct approval. The hold action itself (the
`/api/admin/booking-requests/[id]/hold` route and `holdBookingRequestSlots`) is
unchanged and stays type-agnostic — only the UI entry point is gated, and sending
a quote still reuses any existing hold idempotently. The hold scope covers every
request-converted PENDING booking, including requests approved DIRECTLY without a
quote — intended.

### Member whole-lodge requests (#2263)

A signed-in member may ask for sole occupancy of the lodge
(`POST /api/booking-requests/whole-lodge`). The row is an ordinary
`BookingRequest` — no new `BookingRequestType` and no new
`BookingRequestStatus` — discriminated everywhere by
`requestedByMemberId != null && exclusivityRequested`. It is the ONLY member-origin
kind of booking request; a public or school request always has
`requestedByMemberId` null.

```text
(member submits) -> VERIFIED   (no email verification: the requester is signed in,
                                so no verification token is ever issued; verifiedAt
                                is stamped at creation and the row lands straight
                                in the officer queue holding NO capacity)
VERIFIED -> APPROVED -> CONVERTED  (officer approves with a priced headcount; a
                                CONFIRMED booking is created, owned by the
                                requesting login member, with wholeLodgeHold
                                stamped by the approving admin)
PRICED   -> APPROVED -> CONVERTED  (same transition, defensive: see the note
                                below — nothing sanctioned puts a member-origin
                                row in PRICED, and the approval accepts it
                                anyway rather than dead-ending a row that
                                somehow got there)
VERIFIED -> DECLINED           (officer declines; the note is audit-log-only)
VERIFIED -> CANCELLED          (the MEMBER withdraws it)
```

**Why `PRICED` appears above when the prose below says these rows never reach it.**
Both are true and the difference matters. Nothing sanctioned can price a
member-origin row: `priceBookingRequest` throws `409` for it and the admin queue
offers no price control. But `approveMemberWholeLodgeRequest`'s status guard, and
its `updateMany` claim, both accept `{ VERIFIED, PRICED }`. That is deliberate
tolerance rather than an admission that the state is reachable: if a future change
(or a hand-run database fix) leaves such a row in `PRICED`, the officer can still
approve it instead of meeting a `409` on a row with no other way forward. The
guard is a wider door than the pipeline can currently reach — the narrow
statement "these rows never reach `PRICED`" describes what the code PRODUCES, and
this diagram line describes what the approval ACCEPTS.

**The quote lifecycle is refused, at the service layer.** `createBookingRequestQuote`,
`sendBookingRequestQuote`, `holdBookingRequestSlots` and `priceBookingRequest` each
throw `409` for a member-origin whole-lodge row, and the admin queue hides their
buttons. Hiding is the UX; the 409 is the guarantee. The reason is not tidiness:
quote-send auto-holds capacity (#1280), the quote email is a member-visible
pricing surface the design excludes, and requester-accept mints a duplicate
non-login member for somebody who already has a login account. So these rows
never reach `PRICED`/`QUOTED`/`QUOTE_SENT`/`QUERY_PENDING`/`MODIFICATION_REQUESTED`
and never carry `heldBookingId` — the shared pipeline still handles those states
if a row somehow acquires one, but nothing sanctioned produces one.

**Withdrawal** (`POST /api/booking-requests/whole-lodge/[id]/withdraw`) is a
status-guarded `updateMany` to `CANCELLED` whose WHERE also names
`requestedByMemberId` (ownership is part of the claim, so another member's id
behaves exactly like a non-existent one) **and `heldBookingId: null`**. That last
clause is load-bearing: member withdraw has no hold-release machinery, so
cancelling a row that holds beds would strand an `AWAITING_REVIEW` hold forever
with nothing left to release it. The blocked member gets the fixed `409`; the
resolution path is admin **decline**, which does release holds. Any stray `SENT`
quote is retired to `SUPERSEDED` in the same transaction, request row locked
first (the #1423 lock-ordering invariant). The loser of a
withdraw-vs-approve/decline race gets the same `409`.

**Decline** on a member-origin row keeps the officer's note in the audit metadata
ONLY: `declineReason` stays null on the row, and the decline email renders its
fixed generic body with no note and nothing derived from availability. The
school/public `declineReason` is the field the requester is SHOWN, and an
availability-derived sentence in it would be exactly the disclosure ADR-001
decision 6 forbids. Not persisting is deliberately stronger than
persist-and-filter: a null column cannot be leaked by a surface added later.

**Retention (owner decision OD-B).** `purgeExpiredBookingRequests` hard-deletes
member-origin `DECLINED` rows (already covered by the declined sweep) and
member-origin `CANCELLED` rows on the same 90-day clock. The `CANCELLED` sweep is
scoped to `requestedByMemberId != null` because a public request also reaches
`CANCELLED` (a requester cancelling their own quote) and OD-B decided retention
only for the member-origin flow. "My requests" therefore shows a bounded history,
and its copy says so.

**Member merge.** `BookingRequest.requestedByMemberId` is classified `move` in
`MEMBER_MERGE_RELATION_SPECS`: a loser's requests re-point to the surviving
member, who then owns them in "My requests" and may withdraw them. A merge can
transiently push the master past the 2-open-request cap. That is accepted: the
cap is a **creation-time guard, not an invariant** — it stops a member opening a
third request, and nothing in the system reads it as a promise that no member
ever holds more than two.

Token-link outcomes the requester can see:

- Valid `SENT` link: the quote is shown with options, price, and an expiry hint.
- Not found: `404` "This quote is not valid."
- Status no longer `SENT`: `409` "This quote is no longer active." (use the latest quote email).
- Past expiry: `410` "This quote has expired." with a recover-by-contacting-the-club path.
- Accept after the lodge fills: the request reverts to `QUOTE_SENT`, the link stays
  active, and the requester is told which nights are now full.
- Any action after an admin declined the request (#1423): the decline retired the
  quote (`SENT` -> `SUPERSEDED`), so the link now returns the `409` "This quote is
  no longer active." above for accept / modify / query / cancel alike. In the rare
  case a requester POST loaded the still-`SENT` quote a moment before the
  retirement committed, the status-guarded re-arm / re-status is the backstop and
  `409`s ("...has been declined or cancelled."), creating no booking and never
  resurrecting the request.
- Accept racing the expiry / hold-release cron (owner-ratified, #1317): harmless.
  The accept and the cron both serialize on the booking advisory lock, so at most
  one side wins; the loser gets a safe conflict response it can retry, the quote
  link stays active, and no double-booking or data loss occurs.

Every requester transition (accept, cancel, modification request, question) and the
capacity-blocked accept revert is written to AuditLog with `actor: "requester"`. The
parent `BookingRequest` moves NEW -> VERIFIED -> QUOTED -> QUOTE_SENT and then PRICED
(accept), CANCELLED (cancel), MODIFICATION_REQUESTED, or QUERY_PENDING. When an admin
sends a quote, the email-delivery result is recorded so the team can tell whether the
requester actually received the link.

The response window (default 14 days) and a pre-expiry reminder lead time are
admin-configurable under Booking Policies -> Public Booking Requests. The
`quote-expiry-reminders` cron sends one reminder per quote inside the lead window,
rotating the response token so the reminder email carries a fresh working link
(set the reminder lead to 0 to disable reminders). The same cron also releases
the auto-hold behind any SENT quote whose link has expired (#1254): it cancels
the AWAITING_REVIEW held booking, reconciles away its beds, and detaches
`heldBookingId` so the freed capacity is reusable and a re-quote never reuses a
released row. This release runs even when reminders are disabled. The same cron
phase also frees holds stuck behind a MODIFICATION_REQUESTED / QUERY_PENDING
request that has no outstanding SENT quote, once the latest response window
(`max(responseTokenExpiresAt)` across its quotes) has lapsed — otherwise a
"please change X" / "I have a question" bounce would hold a bed indefinitely.
This release only fires when the held booking was itself placed on or before
that deadline: a hold that post-dates the lapsed window — e.g. an admin manually
re-held a SCHOOL request via "Hold slots" (now a school-only UI action, #1385)
after its original quote window had passed — is kept, so the next cron tick never
undoes the deliberate re-hold (#1296).

Because an admin can cancel a held booking directly (every sent quote leaves one,
tagged "Held" on the bed board), `heldBookingId` is detached wherever such a hold
is cancelled — both in the booking-cancel service and defensively in
`holdBookingRequestSlots`, which re-validates the pointed-to booking is still a
live AWAITING_REVIEW hold before reusing it and otherwise creates a fresh hold.
This stops a re-quote from reusing a cancelled row and 409-ing on accept (#1254).

School group requests share this quote lifecycle. The public form shows a soft
warning above 25 total students, teachers, and parent helpers because a club
member must host larger groups, but the hard submission limit remains lodge
capacity. Before approval, admins can adjust the bulk child counts; approval
regenerates the school guest list from the preserved teachers/parent helpers and
the adjusted counts, then reprices and rechecks capacity against that final list.
The non-login records these flows create are classified by `Member.role`, not
counted as paying members: school groups (the school contact and each teacher)
get role `SCHOOL`, and general public booking-request contacts get `NON_MEMBER`.
Both non-member roles grant no access, are excluded from member rosters, and never
owe a membership subscription (see Member roles in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`).

After conversion (or while a hold booking exists), the resulting booking keeps
the negotiated flat price and the standard edit endpoints refuse it — editing
a quoted booking's dates or party is done by re-pricing or issuing a revised
quote from the booking request, never by season-rate repricing
(`docs/DOMAIN_INVARIANTS.md`, #1032).

## Payment Lifecycle

Known statuses: `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`, `REFUNDED`,
`PARTIALLY_REFUNDED`. Known sources: `STRIPE`, `INTERNET_BANKING`.

```text
PENDING -> PROCESSING -> SUCCEEDED
PENDING/PROCESSING -> FAILED
SUCCEEDED -> PARTIALLY_REFUNDED -> REFUNDED
REFUNDED/PARTIALLY_REFUNDED -> (repay, #1765) fresh PRIMARY transaction on the
  same Payment: PENDING/PROCESSING -> SUCCEEDED
```

Booking cancellation honors these transitions (#1473): only a never-captured
payment flips to FAILED at cancel, decided on transaction-ledger capture
evidence — the aggregate mirror alone can lie, because inbound reconciliation
folds modification credit notes into `refundedAmountCents` /
`PARTIALLY_REFUNDED` on never-captured Internet Banking payments (see
`docs/DOMAIN_INVARIANTS.md`). Genuinely captured payments survive the cancel
unchanged — no *transaction* ever leaves the refunded states.

Repay-after-refund (#1765): a booking that was paid, then deliberately
refunded, then left (or re-put) in a payable status legitimately owes a fresh
payment — refund + promo reprice can produce this. The model is a **fresh
`PRIMARY` `PaymentTransaction` on the same `Payment` row**; the refunded
transaction is immutable history. Because a fully refunded Stripe
PaymentIntent keeps `status: "succeeded"` forever (refunds hang off the
charge), every reconciliation entry point discriminates *refund history* from
*crashed-webhook recovery* on the local transaction ledger, never on the
intent status: a transaction in `REFUNDED`/`PARTIALLY_REFUNDED` is history and
is never re-admitted as settlement (`markBookingPaymentSucceeded` throws;
`create-payment-intent` supersedes the stale pointer and mints a fresh
card-entry intent at the current effective price under a per-repay-generation
idempotency key `pi_<bookingId>_repay_<supersededIntentId>`), while a
transaction still `PENDING`/`PROCESSING` against a succeeded intent is genuine
recovery and reconciles exactly as before. After a repay settles, the Payment
AGGREGATE returns to `PARTIALLY_REFUNDED` (gross captured across generations
minus what was refunded), so the mirror invariant is net-based —
`(amountCents − refundedAmountCents) + creditAppliedCents = finalPriceCents`
at repay settlement (see `docs/DOMAIN_INVARIANTS.md`). The repay path assumes
no saved card: it always goes through the immediate card-entry PaymentIntent
flow.

Duplicate capture on an already-PAID booking (#1992): when a success arrives
carrying the SAME intent the booking settled with, every reconciliation path
returns `already_paid` unchanged (webhook redelivery, confirm-payment racing
the webhook, payment-link reconcile, charge-saved-method / cron reruns
replaying their `pending_charge_` Stripe idempotency key,
confirm-pending-guests retries). A success carrying a DIFFERENT intent while
another captured PRIMARY transaction still holds net cash is double money (the
residual #1967 split-child link-vs-auto-charge window) and is auto-refunded:
the duplicate's transaction goes `SUCCEEDED -> REFUNDED` via a durable
`duplicate_capture_<bookingId>_<pi>` recovery operation, the settlement
transaction and the booking's PAID status are untouched, and
`markBookingPaymentSucceeded` reports `duplicate_capture_refunded` /
`duplicate_capture_refund_failed`. A fully `REFUNDED` prior capture is history
(#1765), never a settlement a repay generation could "duplicate", and at most
one side of a capture pair is ever refunded (adjudicated under `lock(1)`).

Audit trail (#2008): the auto-refund is recorded as a durable, ADMIN-ONLY
`BookingEvent` once its recovery operation reaches `SUCCEEDED` — a `REFUNDED`
event carrying a `duplicate_capture_refund` discriminator in its `snapshot`
(`src/lib/duplicate-capture-refund-event.ts`). It is written exactly once
across the inline and cron-replay paths, each gated on the operation's terminal
`SUCCEEDED` transition (`count > 0`). Because the discriminator makes
`isDuplicateCaptureRefundEvent` true, `resolveBookingNarrative` EXCLUDES it from
the settlement finder, so a later member cancellation never misreads it as its
own refund clause. The admin booking-history timeline renders it with honest
copy ("Duplicate capture auto-refunded — the booking's settlement is
unaffected"), while the shared member/guest narrative and every member-facing
surface show nothing new. The rest of the audit trail (recovery-operation row,
`PaymentRefund` ledger entries, error log, and the dedicated #2007 admin alert)
is unchanged.

### Manual mark-paid (cash / off-Xero bank transfer), B5 #2262

A finance:edit admin action that settles a booking's payment for money the app
never saw. It is a SIBLING ENTRY POINT into the one settlement body, so the
booking-side transition is the ordinary settlement one:

```text
Booking: PAYMENT_PENDING | CONFIRMED | PENDING | DRAFT -> PAID
Payment: PENDING/PROCESSING/FAILED -> SUCCEEDED, source coerced to
  INTERNET_BANKING, provenance columns written (manuallyMarkedPaidAt / By /
  note / manuallyMarkedPaidPreviousStatus). FAILED is a legitimate settle-from
  status — a declined/expired card attempt is exactly the case an admin
  remedies with cash — and the fenced write carries this status set as a WHERE
  condition, so an already-SUCCEEDED or refund-bearing payment can never be
  clobbered to a manual settlement.
PaymentTransaction: an INTERNET_BANKING PRIMARY row with NO Stripe intent id,
  reason "manual_mark_paid", -> SUCCEEDED
```

#2397 — an OUTSTANDING upward-modification delta on the same booking. The admin
is asked whether the cash covers it (no default, and the answer is part of the
settle's contract). The delta is a SLICE of the amount owing — an upward
modification raised `finalPriceCents` by the same amount it recorded as the
extra — so the PRIMARY transaction is the booking's worth BEFORE the change
under **both** answers, and the answer decides what sits beside it:

```text
covered:
  Payment: amountCents = finalPriceCents - credit
           additionalPaymentStatus PENDING|FAILED|null -> "SUCCEEDED"
           (re-asserted in the fenced write on the exact additionalAmountCents)
  PaymentTransaction: PRIMARY = (finalPriceCents - credit - delta), plus an
    INTERNET_BANKING ADDITIONAL row with NO Stripe intent id, reason
    "manual_mark_paid_additional", -> SUCCEEDED. The two sum to amountCents:
    the cash is SPLIT, never doubled.
  AuditLog: a second row, "booking-payment.manual-payment.additional-settled",
    which is what puts the extra on the booking-history timeline

NOT covered (owner decision, 31 Jul 2026 — record what was handed over):
  Payment: amountCents = finalPriceCents - credit - delta
           additional* columns UNTOUCHED, so the delta is still owed and still
           chased
  PaymentTransaction: PRIMARY = (finalPriceCents - credit - delta). No
    ADDITIONAL row.
```

The generalised ledger mirror, which holds for both answers (and already held
for a card-settled booking carrying an uncollected addition):

```text
amountCents + creditAppliedCents + (uncollected addition) = finalPriceCents
```

It is not asserted at runtime inside the settle — the settled figure is defined
as the left-hand side, so any in-transaction check is a tautology. It is upheld
by construction (the two rows are a split of one figure), by the fenced write's
WHERE clauses, and after the fact by `auditIbAppliedCreditStrands`; see
`docs/DOMAIN_INVARIANTS.md` for the full statement.

Stripe-intent hygiene differs by answer. Both answers enqueue a durable
CANCEL_PAYMENT_INTENT for every live Stripe intent on the payment, EXCEPT that
a NOT-covered answer spares the payment's current `additionalPaymentIntentId`:
that extra is still owed, and that intent is the member's only self-service way
to pay it. Superseded addition intents are still cancelled, and the covered
answer cancels the addition's intent like any other.

On the reversal, the reversed amount is the figure that was written. A covered
extra goes back to owing: the ADDITIONAL row SUCCEEDED -> FAILED (reason
"manual_mark_paid_additional_reversed") and `additionalPaymentStatus` is restored
by a guarded claim matching exactly the amount and status the settle recorded. A
not-covered settle left the extra owing throughout, so there is nothing to
restore.

Refused (409, nothing written) when the booking is already PAID, is not in a
payable status, participates in a group settlement, has ANY Xero invoice
evidence including a queued mint, carries any refund history
(`refundedAmountCents > 0`), is in a payment status OUTSIDE
PENDING/PROCESSING/FAILED — i.e. has already taken money, refused at read time
since #2397 with a message that says so rather than at the fence with
"changed while you were recording it" — owes nothing, no longer fits the lodge, when
the amount owing moved since the admin's dialog rendered, or (#2397) when the
outstanding extra moved, appeared, or vanished since it did — including when an
answer arrives for an extra that no longer exists, when an extra exists and no
answer was given, when the extra is larger than the whole amount owing (either
answer), and when a "not covered" answer would leave nothing to record because
the extra IS the whole amount owing.

Reversal (`direction: "unpaid"`), permitted only while nothing has happened
that it could not undo:

```text
Booking: PAID -> manuallyMarkedPaidPreviousStatus
  …except a stored DRAFT, which restores as PAYMENT_PENDING (the PAID claim
  cleared draftExpiresAt, so a restored DRAFT would never expire)
Payment: SUCCEEDED -> PENDING, provenance cleared, source left as-is; a
  restored CONFIRMED internet-banking hold deadline is CLEARED
PaymentTransaction (the manual PRIMARY row): SUCCEEDED -> FAILED,
  reason "manual_mark_paid_reversed" — history, never deleted, and never
  resurrected by a later re-mark (the mint predicate skips FAILED rows)
PaymentRecoveryOperation (every CANCEL_PAYMENT_INTENT /
  REFUND_SUPERSEDED_PAYMENT on this payment still PENDING|PROCESSING):
  DELETED, inside the reversal's transaction — not flipped to a terminal
  status, because every webhook-side liveness predicate keys on
  `status != SUCCEEDED` and a FAILED "closed" row would still hand a
  post-reversal capture to the superseded-refund machinery. The deleted rows'
  full content is preserved on the reversal's AuditLog entry, and a member-owed
  superseded refund can never be reached: its settled transaction 409s the
  reversal first.
```

Both directions record an `AuditLog` naming the acting admin, and the reversal
records a durable `BookingEvent` — a `CANCELLED` event carrying the
`manual_mark_paid_reversed` discriminator
(`src/lib/manual-settlement-reversal-event.ts`), which the shared narrative
EXCLUDES so a later genuine cancellation is not misdated by it. The reciprocal
inbound fence records its conflict the same way, under the
`manual_settlement_xero_conflict` discriminator.

### Manual refund task lifecycle (#2262)

```text
OPEN -> COMPLETED   (finance:edit; writes the local refund allocation and a
                     REFUNDED BookingEvent — the ONLY moment the ledger says
                     the money went back)
OPEN -> DISMISSED   (finance:edit; requires a note; moves no money)
OPEN -> DISMISSED   (#2700: the Stripe webhook, with NO acting member at all —
                     `completedByMemberId` stays null and no operator note is
                     required. Fires only on a task raised by the deleted-booking
                     modification-payment path, matched on that exact payment
                     intent, when `handleCancelledBookingAdditionalPaymentSucceeded`
                     has already refunded the capture, so the task's question is
                     answered. Status-fenced on OPEN, so a replay or an operator
                     who got there first claims nothing. Moves no money —
                     COMPLETED here would write a SECOND refund allocation for
                     one refund. See `INV-ADDPAY-036`.)
```

**Where a terminal row is read, and the #2750 decision behind it.** Both
terminal states are terminal for the row, not for the operator: the finance
queue on `/admin/payments` shows OPEN rows as work to settle, and since #2750
also shows the webhook-closed rows above as a read-only **"Refunded
automatically — nothing to pay back"** card, bounded to the last
`AUTOMATIC_REFUND_NOTICE_WINDOW_DAYS` (30) by `completedAt`. Before that, the
webhook's own close took the row off the only screen it ever appeared on, so that
durable record of an automatic refund was visible only to somebody who thought to
query the table.

**That card is complete for BOTH late-capture paths since #2760 then #2773, and it
used not to be.** As #2750 shipped it
the task had a single creator — the confirm-modification-payment endpoint — so a row
existed only on the ordering where the member's browser got there before the webhook
did. Webhook first (the healthy case), a member who closes the tab after paying, and
the interleaved ordering the raise's own refund fence declines all refunded the
capture and left nothing for the close to claim, and the raise never fired at all
for a booking that is CANCELLED but not deleted. The webhook now writes the
DISMISSED row itself when its OPEN-fenced close claims nothing, for both
populations (`recordAutomaticCancelledBookingRefundTask`, #2760 — owner decision
10 Aug 2026). #2773 then routed the SIBLING handler for a booking's OWN payment,
`handleCancelledBookingPaymentSucceeded`, through the same writer, so every
automatic refund of a late capture inside the card's window is on the card — an
orchestrator decision the owner has not ruled on, reversible, with the authority
line under `INV-ADDPAY-039`. The two are stated as separate sentences on purpose:
a real owner decision and an unruled one sitting inside one clause is what made
this branch's fabricated attribution credible in the first place. The card groups the deleted rows apart from the merely cancelled ones so
normal operation cannot bury the interesting case. What is still bounded is the
window, not the record: the row and the
`booking.payment.refunded_after_cancellation` audit entry are permanent.

**Both handlers share ONE implementation of the epilogue**
(`src/lib/cancelled-booking-late-capture.ts`): one record writer, one post-refund
`deletedAt` re-read, one alert decision. Four `reason` sentences exist, one per
(capture kind, population), because the sentence is stored on the row and printed on
the card — calling a booking's own payment a "booking modification payment" would
print an operator-facing falsehood.

**Two exceptions in `INV-ADDPAY-037` remain, and a reader of this diagram should not
assume them away.** An operator who resolves the `OPEN` task by hand before the
refund lands leaves a row that matches neither the close nor the card's filter, so
that refund reaches no card and is named only at WARN — the carve-out #2774 D1 keeps,
an orchestrator decision the owner has not ruled on (authority line under
`INV-ADDPAY-039`). And if the record write itself fails the handler still
answers 200, so the row is lost for good; the `critical`
`booking.payment.auto_refund_record_failed` audit entry is the only place it
surfaces.

**AND SINCE #2774 ONE THING CAN STOP THE REFUND ITSELF (`INV-ADDPAY-039`).** If a
`ManualRefundTask` for the capture is already `COMPLETED`, an operator has paid the
member back by hand and `applyLocalRefundAllocation` wrote the allocation — so
Stripe's refund on top of it pays the member twice. The refund is withheld before it
is made, a `critical` `booking.payment.late_capture_refund_withheld` row is written
(`outcome: "blocked"`, never `refunded_after_cancellation`, which would claim a
refund that did not happen), and the club is alerted that the money did NOT go.
`DISMISSED` must NOT block: no allocation exists, so blocking would leave the club
holding the member's captured funds. A hand-completion landing DURING the refund is
not preventable without holding `pg_advisory_xact_lock(1)` across a Stripe call, so
it is detected afterwards instead and reported as
`booking.payment.late_capture_double_refund_suspected`.

#2750 asked whether the #1350 automatic refund should instead be **gated**,
leaving the task OPEN so a person decides. It was not, and the reasoning is
recorded rather than assumed: the member's money returning is the safe direction
when nobody is watching, gating it means the club holds a member's money until
somebody acts, and it would put a new condition on a Critical webhook money
path. The club is already emailed the moment it happens —
`handleCancelledBookingAdditionalPaymentSucceeded` has always mailed an admin alert
on this path, naming the amount and the auto-refund, and since #2761 that mail has
its own accurate subject and cannot be muted (`INV-ADDPAY-038`); since #2773 the
primary handler sends the same mail instead of the generic muteable "Payment Failed"
one — so what was missing was somewhere to look afterwards, not a notification.
Exactly one notification per event still holds across all three outcomes: the
auto-refund alert, the withheld-refund alert, or the possible-double-payment
alert, never two of them. The card
carries no controls — there is no decision left, and "Mark paid back" on such a
row would write a second refund allocation — and its copy names the one thing an
operator may still have to do: if the deletion rather than the payment was the
mistake, the booking has to be made again and the member charged again, because
the refund has already gone out. The rows it shows are defined once, in
`automaticallyRefundedManualRefundTaskFilter` (`INV-ADDPAY-037`), which the
route uses rather than restating; an operator's own dismissal never appears
there.

There are THREE creators, and only the first two ever make an OPEN row:

- Created atomically with the CANCELLED claim when a **cash-settled** booking is
  cancelled with a non-zero policy refund. A zero-refund outcome creates no task.
- Created by `confirm-modification-payment` when a **card** modification payment
  is captured against a booking the club has already soft-deleted (#2700,
  `INV-ADDPAY-036`): the capture is recorded rather than refused, and an OPEN
  task asks a person to decide. Raised under `pg_advisory_xact_lock(1)`,
  idempotent on the payment intent, and fenced against a refund that already
  happened, so it is never raised for money Stripe has already returned.
- Created **already DISMISSED** by the Stripe webhook when it auto-refunds a late
  capture on a cancelled booking and its OPEN-fenced close claims nothing (#2760,
  `INV-ADDPAY-037`), from EITHER late-capture handler since #2773. Never OPEN —
  there is no work, and completing such a row throws out of
  `applyLocalRefundAllocation` — and never `COMPLETED`, which would write a second
  refund allocation for one refund. Both populations and both capture kinds, each
  storing its own `reason` sentence; every lookup matches all four sentences, so a
  deletion landing between two Stripe deliveries cannot produce two rows and a
  future writer cannot key on its own sentence alone. Under the same
  `pg_advisory_xact_lock(1)` as the raise above, because close-or-create is a
  find-then-write rather than an atomic fenced update. On the PRIMARY path there is
  never an `OPEN` row to close — nothing raises one for a primary intent — so the
  create arm is the only one reachable there.
The transition is a status-fenced conditional update, so a double click can
never double-apply the allocation, and the row is never processed by any cron —
it deliberately is not a `PaymentRecoveryOperation`. (That dispatcher's final
arm used to execute ANY unknown enum member as a superseded-payment Stripe
refund; since #2262 it rejects an unhandled type with an explicit throw, but a
task a cron must never execute still does not belong in a cron-executed table.)

To verify: whether Internet Banking uses the same `PaymentStatus` transitions
or Xero invoice state as the effective settlement state.

## Seasonal Membership Assignment Lifecycle

```text
seed/backfill creates current-season assignment
admin previews member seasonal type change
admin enters reason and saves with matching preview token
audited assignment create/update
season roll-forward dry-run -> reviewed exceptions -> idempotent copy
```

The preview reports future confirmed bookings, draft bookings, waitlist records,
current subscription state, recent subscription history, and resulting booking
and subscription behavior. The save does not reprice existing future bookings,
rewrite subscription/payment/Xero history, or call provider systems. The saved
assignment is enforced the next time a booking is quoted, created, confirmed
from draft, joined, or repriced by an allowed modification path.

## Fee Configuration Lifecycle

```text
migration -> public membership types hidden
legacy entrance amount -> authoritative row at migration-date boundary
membership editor -> public copy/listing review -> audited save -> cache invalidation
finance editor -> validate cents/dates -> lock schedule key -> reject overlap | audited save
family billing mode = via billing member -> family recipient removed -> billing member cleared -> visible billing exception
family billing mode = members individually -> family-billing card hidden, no billing-member exceptions, PER_FAMILY create/update rejected server-side
```

The `familyBillingMode` setting on `MembershipSubscriptionBillingSettings` (edited
from `/admin/subscriptions`) selects between the two branches above. It defaults
to `BILL_FAMILY_VIA_BILLING_MEMBER`, so existing clubs keep today's behaviour.

This lifecycle creates no invoice and calls no provider. During the one-release
bridge, a category with no current entrance schedule reads its deprecated
granular/flat mapping amount; a current schedule always wins.

## Membership Subscription Charge Lifecycle

```text
annual preview (read-only) -> explicit unchanged-token confirmation -> QUEUED
new-member approval -> configured plan -> QUEUED
new-member approval -> incomplete plan -> OPEN billing exception (approval stays APPROVED)
QUEUED -> outbox claim -> invoice create OR exact existing-invoice adoption
invoice identity persisted locally -> INVOICE_CREATED -> Xero email -> EMAILED
INVOICE_CREATED -> email fails -> EMAIL_FAILED -> retry -> same invoice -> EMAILED
provider reference exists but snapshot differs -> CONFLICT (no provider rewrite)
provider reference exists but is not AUTHORISED -> CONFLICT (never emailed)
late member joins already-billed family -> FAMILY_ALREADY_BILLED exception (old coverage unchanged; no second invoice)
stale per-family schedule under individual billing -> PER_FAMILY_FEE_IN_INDIVIDUAL_MODE exception (no invoice; basis must change)
NO_INVOICE -> NOT_REQUIRED (zero-cent durable snapshot; no provider work)
age-tier not subscription-liable, no PER_MEMBER fee due -> Exempt (no charge, no MISSING_FEE_SCHEDULE; confirm writes NOT_REQUIRED; PER_FAMILY child stays family-covered)
OPEN exception -> superseding confirm run -> RESOLVED (resolvedVia CONFIRM)
OPEN exception -> edit-gated preview refresh no longer regenerates it -> RESOLVED (resolvedVia PREVIEW_RECONCILE; whole-club refresh resolves every superseded OPEN row, member-specific and club-level null-member alike; read-only GET never resolves)
```

To verify: preview digest changes with fee/recipient/due-day inputs; only finance
edit can confirm/retry/configure; explicit account/item mapping is frozen;
concurrent/replayed confirmation creates one
coverage row; fee/family changes do not mutate history; invoice identity commits
before email; email retry never calls create for a persisted invoice; exact
existing invoices are adopted; amount/contact/account mismatch becomes visible
`CONFLICT`; automatic post-approval failures never roll back approval.

## Member Subscription Status Transitions

`MemberSubscription.status` is one of `NOT_INVOICED`, `NOT_REQUIRED`, `UNPAID`,
`PAID`, `OVERDUE`.

```text
(no row) -> NOT_REQUIRED            membership type never owes (ensureDefaultSeasonSubscriptionForNewMember, billing NO_INVOICE)
(no row) -> NOT_INVOICED            billing sweep creates a billable-but-uninvoiced row
NOT_REQUIRED -> NOT_INVOICED        REQUIRED-type season assignment supersedes a stale creation-seeded NOT_REQUIRED row (reconcileSeasonSubscriptionForAssignment, #2149)
NOT_INVOICED -> UNPAID              Xero subscription invoice created (xero-subscription-invoices)
UNPAID/OVERDUE <-> PAID             Xero discovery/webhook reflects the invoice's real payment state
UNPAID/OVERDUE/PAID -> NOT_INVOICED Xero invoice observed VOIDED/DELETED (#2147): invoice link nulled, member re-billable — deliberately reads NOT locked out (was UNPAID/locked out pre-#2147)
NOT_INVOICED -> PAID (manual)       manual mark-paid (finance:edit) — sets manuallyMarkedPaidAt/By/Note, never calls Xero
PAID (manual) -> NOT_INVOICED      manual reversal when no Xero invoice link exists (clears provenance)
PAID (manual) -> UNPAID            manual reversal on a legacy row that somehow carries an invoice link (clears provenance)
PAID (manual) -> Xero-derived       a real Xero invoice links: Xero is authoritative again and the write clears the manual provenance columns
```

Guards: manual mark-paid exists for cash payments where NO Xero invoice exists,
so it is rejected (409) when the row carries a Xero invoice link ("record the
payment against the invoice in Xero instead"), when the row is already `PAID`,
and on `NOT_REQUIRED` rows (nothing to pay); manual reversal is allowed only on
a row with `manuallyMarkedPaidAt` set. Both manual writes are status-fenced
conditional updates (409 when the row changed concurrently). The annual-invoice
sweep never invoices a row already `PAID` (manual or Xero), and
`createXeroMembershipSubscriptionInvoice` conflicts
(`SUBSCRIPTION_ALREADY_PAID`) instead of minting an invoice for a charge whose
covered subscription became `PAID` while it was queued. `checkMembershipStatus`
never downgrades a manually marked-paid row that carries no Xero invoice link
(enforced by a write-time fence, not just an up-front read), and
`flushMemberSubscriptionHistory` never deletes a manual-PAID row on contact
link/push/unlink. The assignment reconcile
(`reconcileSeasonSubscriptionForAssignment`, #2149) only ever flips a row that is
still the untouched creation-seeded `NOT_REQUIRED` default (null Xero invoice, no
ACTIVE charge-coverage claim — `releasedAt IS NULL`, the #2147 "already billed"
rule, so a released claim from a voided invoice does not block the re-billable
member — and no manual mark-paid) and only when the newly-effective
type is `REQUIRED`; it is a status-guarded, idempotent `updateMany` (no advisory
lock, no provider call) that runs inside the assignment transaction, so it can
never downgrade a paid/invoiced/covered/manual row and never fires for a
`BASED_ON_AGE_TIER` type (whose `NOT_REQUIRED` row is the authoritative #2041
season-start exemption). Every manual transition is audited with the acting admin.

The annual sweep (#2147) skips a member who is already `PAID` **OR** holds a LIVE
Xero invoice link (any of UNPAID/OVERDUE/PAID) — an additive dedup guard so an
invoiced-but-unpaid member is never double-billed, while a manually marked-paid
member (PAID, null invoice link) is still skipped. On a void/delete the sync
marks the covering `MembershipSubscriptionCharge` `VOIDED` (kept for audit, never
re-enqueued), releases its coverage claim (`releasedAt` set — row kept), and
bumps `MemberSubscription.voidGeneration` so a re-bill mints a NEW charge with a
fresh idempotency key.

To verify: manual mark-paid sets PAID + provenance and never calls Xero; the
sweep skips a manual-PAID member and an invoiced-but-unpaid member; a Xero
force-sync leaves a manual-PAID row untouched; a contact link/unlink resync
leaves a manual-PAID row in place; reversal restores UNPAID vs NOT_INVOICED by
invoice-link presence; a voided invoice makes the member NOT_INVOICED and
re-billable with a new charge.

## Committee Assignment Lifecycle

```text
seed/migration creates committee master roles with role email aliases
admin creates or archives master role
admin links member to role from member detail
new assignment starts hidden/unpublished
admin edits blurb/sort/published/show-phone/contactable flags
audited assignment update or deactivate
published assignment appears on public committee surfaces
contactable published assignment can receive server-routed contact form mail through the role email alias, or the linked member email when the role email is blank
```

## Refund And Credit Lifecycle

Known credit types: `CANCELLATION_REFUND`,
`BOOKING_MODIFICATION_REFUND`, `ADMIN_ADJUSTMENT`, `BOOKING_APPLIED`.
Known admin credit adjustment statuses: `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`.
Known refund request statuses: `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`.

```text
refund requested -> approved/rejected -> Stripe refund or Xero credit/member credit
admin credit requested -> approved/rejected -> MemberCredit created/applied
MemberCredit available -> applied to booking -> ledger remains linked
```

To verify: all paths that update refunded totals and whether completed refund
requests are represented by status, payment/refund rows, or both.

## Waitlist Lifecycle

```text
capacity unavailable -> WAITLISTED
capacity opens/admin offers -> WAITLIST_OFFERED
offer accepted -> confirmed or paid booking
offer expires/declined -> WAITLISTED or CANCELLED
stranded free confirm, admin repair -> WAITLISTED
```

Cross-lodge offers (ADR-004, `waitlistOfferedLodgeId` set) accept
differently: the entry never changes lodge. Confirming re-checks the
quoted price, creates a fresh booking at the offered lodge through the
standard creation path, and cancels the waitlist entry with audit links
between the two (`WAITLIST_OFFERED -> CANCELLED` + new booking). Price
drift at confirm refreshes the stored quote and asks the member to
confirm the updated figure; every revert to `WAITLISTED` clears the
offered-lodge fields.

The admin waitlist view decorates active `WAITLIST_OFFERED` rows with the latest
`waitlist-offer` EmailLog status. Failed, exhausted, bounced, or missing delivery
records are surfaced beside the offer with a link to email-deliverability
recovery, so state changes are not hidden behind best-effort email delivery.
A booking carrying the per-booking "No emails" switch (#2258) is excluded from
waitlist candidacy, so no NEW offer is made to a member who would not be told.
The exclusion is not retroactive: a switch turned on while an offer is already
live does not retract it, and the offer commits before its email is sent, so a
flip in between leaves a live offer with a withheld send. An entry in
`WAITLIST_OFFERED` whose offer is still unexpired therefore reports
`suppressed_live_offer` with `needsOperatorAction: true` (a held bed the member
was never told about); one whose offer has already lapsed reports the benign
`suppressed`. A silenced entry still in `WAITLISTED` has no EmailLog row at all
and is marked on the board from the flag; it keeps its queue place and still
counts toward other members' positions.

## Bed Allocation Lifecycle

Known allocation source: `AUTO` or `MANUAL`.

```text
booking confirmed/paid -> auto allocation proposal
admin manually adjusts -> MANUAL allocation
admin approves -> approved allocation metadata set
admin previews + applies removal -> selected rows deleted; causal partner promoted
booking modified/cancelled/completed/deleted -> allocation reconciliation
exclusive whole-lodge hold SET -> allocation reconciliation (pure prune)
exclusive whole-lodge hold CLEARED -> allocation reconciliation (re-plan)
```

The exclusive whole-lodge hold is a first-class reconciliation trigger on BOTH
directions (ADR-001, #2285). A held booking implicitly occupies every bed, so it
owns **no** `BedAllocation` rows: reconciliation short-circuits on the
`wholeLodgeHold` flag (not the status — a held booking sits in an ordinary
bed-allocatable status), which makes the SET a whole-booking prune that creates
nothing, and makes any later reconcile of a still-held booking a no-op that also
self-heals rows an older lifecycle wrongly created. Clearing the hold makes the
booking ordinary again, so the same reconcile re-plans its guests through the
auto-allocator — beds may come back different, and other bookings' provisional
placements may be moved or unallocated by that re-plan. Both directions run
inside the exclusive-hold route's transaction, under the per-lodge capacity
lock, so the flag and the rows can never commit apart; a school approval that
grants exclusivity prunes the same way after stamping the hold. Every write path
additionally re-reads the bookings it is about to write rows for immediately
before the write, so a hold (or cancel, or soft delete) landing between planning
and writing cannot be undone by a re-insert.

Auto-allocation plans booking-first and whole-stay-first (issue #1677). Per
booking (capacity-holding first on the lifecycle path, then createdAt/id), the
planner runs three phases after an adult-coverage carve-out (Phase 0: a
minor-night without a party adult that night or an existing adult allocation is
reported `NO_BOOKING_ADULT` and removed from demand):

1. **Whole-stay in free space** — the first candidate room (rooms already
   holding the booking's allocations, then the requested room, then sort
   order) with enough free beds on EVERY night of the stay takes the whole
   party, with best-effort per-guest bed stability (one bed across the stay
   when possible, within-room bed switches otherwise).
2. **Whole-stay via displacement** (capacity-holding bookings on the lifecycle
   path only; #1387 preserved) — a room is feasible when free beds plus beds
   held by wholly-displaceable provisional bookings cover every night. The
   displacement UNIT is a provisional booking's entire visible stay: evicted
   bookings (newest first) are relocated whole to ONE other room (`MOVE`) or
   wholly unallocated (`UNALLOCATE`) — never night-split, never a MOVE/
   UNALLOCATE mix. A booking with an admin-approved night anywhere, or a stay
   extending beyond the load envelope, is never displaced.
3. **Per-night split fallback** — the legacy whole-night/split logic for
   bookings no single room can host, reported in
   `BedAllocationPlan.roomContinuityFallbackBookingIds`; held-booking
   displacement here still uses the whole-booking primitive. Within a night
   (#1768): minors join rooms already holding the booking's adults, one adult
   then heads each further room with minors while adults last (family
   pairing), leftover adults spread first-fit, and remaining minors **overflow
   into rooms of their own** — the booking's adult count no longer caps how
   many rooms its minors may fill (pre-#1768 a school group with two teachers
   got exactly two rooms and stranded the rest as `NO_BED_AVAILABLE`). A
   booking created from a SCHOOL request (`isSchoolGroup`, derived from the
   origin or held `BookingRequest.type`) inverts the pairing preference:
   its adults room together (one room when they fit) and its students take
   their own rooms.

The selected lodge's `BedAllocationSettings` governs both the explicit board
run and this lifecycle reconcile (#2593). After placement count and the hard
school/age-mix rules, feasible layouts are compared lexicographically in the
saved top-to-bottom order: booking cohesion, stay continuity, requested room,
and direct-family cohesion by default. Any subset — including `[]` — is valid;
omitted settings use the default. The split planner executes at most 24
deterministic matching-layout candidates, including connected-family,
direct-group, direct-pair, capacity-aware high-affinity room packing, and
maximum-cardinality direct-edge pairing orders; whole-room, legacy, and
displacement trials are additional. This is a bounded
heuristic rather than a global optimum. Saving a different order is not a
lifecycle transition and rewrites no allocation: it changes only plans made
after the save.

**Cross-booking age-mix invariant (#1768, all phases and both placement
directions):** a room-night holding minors from booking X never also holds an
adult from a DIFFERENT booking — the planner neither places a minor beside
another booking's adult nor an adult beside another booking's minor,
displacement evicts a conflicting provisional booking whole (or deems the room
infeasible when it cannot), a relocated booking is never MOVEd into a
conflicting room-night (it is wholly UNALLOCATEd instead), and an occupant row
with no booking attribution conservatively blocks minors but not adults.
Persisted rows that already violate the invariant (manual moves, pre-#1768
plans) surface on the board as `MINOR_ADULT_MIX` warnings rather than being
rewritten — warning-only on the manual board is the intended function (owner
decision 2026-07-11), not a pending hard-block. Same-booking mixing is unrestricted — Phase 0 remains the
night-level adult-coverage rule, and minors-only ROOMS are allowed whenever
the booking has an adult on-site that night.

Two occupancies with no booking behind them feed this invariant as
attribution-less rows and so are covered by that last clause: a **custodian bed
hold** (#2286) and, since #2317, an **exclusive whole-lodge hold** — every
active bed of the held lodge on every held night. Both are tierless, so both
read as an adult: another booking's unaccompanied minors are kept out of the
rooms, and no name, booking id or age tier of the held group ever reaches the
planner. Neither can be displaced: neither has a row to move, and — because a
real allocation row may sit on the same bed on the same night, and planner
occupancy is keyed `bedId:stayDate` — the planner also pins those bed-nights as
permanently occupied, so evicting the co-located booking releases that
booking's claim and never the hold's.

Reconciliation widens its loads to the envelope of every booking overlapping
the reconcile range (`min(checkIn) .. max(checkOut)` union the range) so the
planner sees whole stays, while the set of bookings planned stays restricted
to those overlapping the original range (no cascade).

On the admin allocation board, every existing-chip drag/drop and nested
**Move to bed** choice opens one reviewed move dialog. The hovered date column
never changes an existing allocation's night. Pointer and keyboard interactions
name the destination and original night, then stop at confirmation; cancel sends
no request and restores focus. The current bed stays selectable so the admin can
review a person-wide consolidation or an all-noop outcome.

The dialog starts at `ALLOCATION_NIGHT` and may widen to `BOOKING_GUEST`, which
resolves every existing row for that guest on the booking (including sparse and
off-screen rows, up to 366) without creating any. Its read-only preview separates
changed and unchanged rows, exact NZ nights, approval-to-draft consequences,
shared-double promotions, and hard conflicts. Apply carries that scope plus the
anchor, destination and digest — never a target date — and takes global booking
`lock(1)`, the complete sorted lodge union, sorted member-lifecycle and
member-partner-link families, then deterministic allocation-row locks before an
authoritative re-preview. Cancellation uses the same global key, so a post-cancel
move cannot resurrect a row.

A matching apply writes every changed row with one guarded bulk statement,
preserving dates and making approved rows unapproved `MANUAL` drafts. Partner
promotions and their cross-booking causal audit attribution commit in that same
transaction. Any conflict or stale fact refuses the whole move; digest drift
returns a refreshed preview and requires a second confirmation. Unchanged rows
are never re-drafted, promoted, written, or audited, and an all-noop confirmation
succeeds audit-free. Bucket-to-board bulk placement keeps its older per-night
conflict semantics. The legacy allocation-id/destination request remains capped
at 31 rows for older callers but is no longer the board's existing-chip seam.

The board's "Run Auto Allocation" uses the same whole-stay planner without
displacement. Its displayed suggestions are only a preview: the action takes
global booking `lock(1)` then the selected lodge lock, authoritatively rebuilds
only after confirming that lodge is still active, then rebuilds the scoped
inventory/booking/occupancy/hold plan through that transaction and constructs
and inserts AUTO rows. A room or bed deactivated/retyped
after preview therefore cannot be written from the stale plan. The board raises
a stay-level `ROOM_SWITCH` warning when a booking's rooms change between nights,
plus a `MINOR_ADULT_MIX` warning on any persisted room-night that mixes one
booking's minors with another booking's adults (#1768).

**Range assignment (#2251).** "Assign range…" places ONE guest on ONE bed
across a range of any length — the board's 31-night window bounds the read, not
the write. The write is attempt-first (there is deliberately no dry-run/preview
step) and atomic: any blocked night refuses the WHOLE range, nothing is written,
and the refusal report names each blocked night in one of three distinct
categories — the bed is already allocated that night (naming the occupying
guest; a provisional occupant still counts, so nothing is silently overwritten),
the guest is not booked that night (a **bad request**, never a silent skip —
including a gap night of a non-contiguous stay, #713), or **the guest's own
booking** holds the whole lodge (ADR-001's short-circuit — a held booking owns no
per-bed rows, so the whole range is refused). Another booking's overlapping hold
is NOT a blocker here: it is surfaced on the board as a banner and an
`overlapsExclusiveHold` badge, exactly as it is for every other allocation path.
A second, explicit "assign the N free nights" action re-sends the exact night
list the report showed, and the server writes that set or refuses it with a fresh
report. When the report contains nights the guest is not booked on, that action
asks for an explicit confirmation first — naming how many nights are not part of
the guest's booking and will NOT be assigned, and how many will — so a partial write is never
one click away from a warning. Either way the operation records exactly one
`BED_ALLOCATION_RANGE_SET`
audit entry (`targetId` = the booking id, written inside the same transaction as
the rows) carrying the requested range, what was written, and what was refused —
as counts and night runs, without the other bookings' guest names, which stay in
the response to the admin. If the move stranded partners on shared doubles, the
same transaction adds ONE batched `BED_ALLOCATION_PARTNERS_PROMOTED` entry for
all of them (capped list + exact count + truncation flag) rather than one entry
per promotion, so a 366-night range writes a bounded number of audit rows as well
as a bounded number of statements; the single-night and bulk board paths keep
their per-promotion `BED_ALLOCATION_PARTNER_PROMOTED` entries. Range assignments
**auto-approve**: their rows land with `approvedAt`/`approvedByMemberId` stamped
rather than as drafts. Board single-night and drag placements are deliberately
NOT auto-approved — draft-vs-approved remains the suggestion-vs-confirmation
distinction. One consequence to state plainly: because
`isBookingBedAllocationLocked` is "at least one approved row exists" (#776), the
member's requested-room editing locks on the FIRST range assign, not at a later
confirmation step; the assign dialog says so before the admin commits. Manual
allocation of a whole-lodge-held booking is refused outright at the write
chokepoint, matching the lifecycle prune (#2285).

**Reviewed removal (#2594).** Removal is an explicit PREVIEW → APPLY transition,
not a one-click row delete. Preview writes nothing and classifies a non-empty
selection as Auto draft, Manual draft, and/or Approved within exactly one scope:
the anchored allocation, that person on that booking, the whole booking, or the
selected lodge's visible half-open window (maximum 31 nights). Person and
booking scope include matching rows outside the page; window scope does not.
The preview states category counts, affected bookings/nights, causal
shared-double promotions, and which bookings will have no approved row left and
therefore re-open requested-room editing.

APPLY must carry that preview's `v1:<sha256>` digest. Under global `lock(1)` →
the sorted immutable booking/anchor lodge locks → sorted selected/causal
allocation-row locks, it rebuilds the same state and refuses any historical
third-lodge anomaly. Drift produces a 409 refreshed preview and no
transition. A match atomically deletes every selected row, changes each
surviving causal shared-double occupant from second to primary, and records
`BED_ALLOCATION_REMOVAL_APPLIED` plus the bounded
`BED_ALLOCATION_PARTNERS_PROMOTED` audit when needed. There is deliberately no
edge from APPLY to auto-allocation: freed nights stay unallocated until a later
manual placement or explicit **Run Auto Allocation**. Preview requires
`bookings:view`; APPLY requires `bookings:edit`; the retired direct
`DELETE /api/admin/bed-allocation/allocations/[id]` is no longer a transition.
When only the opening row of a booking/person scope disappeared, the 409 preview
re-anchors to the lowest-id matching survivor; the current apply still writes
nothing, while a newly reviewed apply is no longer trapped on a dead row id.

Draft rows still arise constantly, which is why a confirmation step remains a
real affordance rather than a legacy one: board single-night and drag placements
create them, auto-allocation writes `source: "AUTO"` suggestions as drafts, and a
MOVE **re-drafts** an approved row (the upsert's update branch clears
`approvedAt`/`approvedByMemberId`). From inside a booking (#2252) those drafts
are approved with a **booking-scoped** approval: `approveBedAllocations` takes
`bookingId` as a first-class selector, sufficient on its own, so confirming one
booking can never stamp another booking's pending rows the way the `from`/`to`
form would. It carries the panel's ADR-003 lodge scope too, so the write scope
matches the lodge-scoped read the card displayed. That approval audits
`BED_ALLOCATION_APPROVED` with `targetId` = the booking id, so the booking's own
audit deep link finds it.

The room-request lock is therefore **two-way**, and the surfaces say so. No
un-approve action exists or is invented, but two paths can take a booking's last
approved row away and re-open the member's editor: the move re-draft above and
reviewed removal. The removal preview decides that from the booking's complete
approved-row set rather than the window on screen, because the panel pages a
stay longer than 31 nights and cannot see the rest of it. Approval, removal, and
member requested-room writes share the global serialization boundary and use
row locks/guarded predicates so a concurrent winner changes the authoritative
answer rather than crossing this transition stale.

To verify: approval status representation, conflict handling, per-night guest
uniqueness, room continuity and whole-booking displacement behavior, range
refusal categories and their single audit entry, and module-disabled behavior.

## Membership Application Lifecycle

Known statuses: `PENDING_NOMINATORS`, `PENDING_ADMIN`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`.

```text
application submitted -> PENDING_NOMINATORS
nominations complete -> PENDING_ADMIN
admin approves -> APPROVED -> member/setup/invoice path
admin refreshes pending nomination workflow -> PENDING_NOMINATORS with fresh links
admin replaces an unconfirmed nominator -> PENDING_NOMINATORS with a fresh link
admin rejects (fallback from PENDING_NOMINATORS or PENDING_ADMIN) -> REJECTED
```

On the `admin approves` transition each person (the applicant and every family
member) is either created new (default, unchanged) or **mapped onto an existing
member** — a link + field overwrite gated by a previewed, HMAC-token-bound
second check. Mapping recomputes the outcome from advisory-locked, reloaded rows
inside the approval transaction and 409s on any drift (row or recomputed value),
so concurrent approvals of the same target serialize. A mapped applicant with an
existing login keeps its auth; a mapped non-login applicant is promoted to a
login account; mapped family members never have auth/email rewritten. Mapped
targets that already hold season coverage are excluded from new subscription
billing, and a mapped applicant defaults the joining fee to skip. Approving with
no mapping decisions is byte-identical to the create-everyone path.

An admin may reject from either pending state, but `PENDING_NOMINATORS`
applications have non-destructive recovery first. The reminder cron renews each
unconfirmed nominator link weekly for up to four automatic reminders. The admin
member-applications screen can refresh all pending nominator links immediately,
resetting that four-reminder cycle, or replace an unconfirmed nominator with
another eligible member. Rejecting a `PENDING_NOMINATORS` application remains
the fallback withdrawal/clearance path; `REJECTED` is excluded from the
duplicate-application check, so the applicant can submit a fresh application
when needed. Approval stays restricted to `PENDING_ADMIN`.

To verify: duplicate applicant behavior, nomination expiry, setup invite
creation, Xero entrance-fee invoice path, reminder renewal, admin refresh,
nominator replacement, and email retry behavior.

## Seasonal Membership Type Policy

```text
built-in type seeded -> admin reviews policy -> type edited/reordered
custom type created -> active -> archived -> reactivated
member role backfill -> current-season assignment created if missing
type assignment preview -> apply-from date/reason saved -> audited assignment update
booking quote/create/modify -> resolve season assignment/default -> member rate, non-member rate, or block
subscription display/gate -> resolve season assignment/default -> required or not required
```

Runtime booking paths resolve the policy for the booking season. `BLOCK_BOOKING`
stops owners or linked member guests with a structured policy error.
`NON_MEMBER_RATE` uses non-member nightly rates while keeping the stored member
identity. `NOT_REQUIRED` changes effective subscription lockout and display
without deleting raw subscription, payment, or Xero invoice history. Membership
type is the sole authority for the subscription-required answer (#2149): access
**role carries no exemption of its own**. `ADMIN` and `LODGE` accounts are exempt
only because — with no explicit season assignment — they resolve via the
role→default-type fallback to their own built-in `NOT_REQUIRED` types (`ADMIN` =
BLOCK_BOOKING, `LODGE` = MEMBER_RATE so the kiosk still books); a fee-paying
human holding the admin permission carries a normal REQUIRED type and owes a
subscription like anyone else. The optional assignment `applyFrom`
date is date-only metadata for mid-season changeover reporting and audit; the
guarded preview remains the required save path and existing future bookings are
not automatically repriced by a type or apply-from change.

## Nomination Lifecycle

```text
nomination token created -> nominator opens token while signed in
token expires before confirmation -> weekly reminder issues a fresh token
four automatic reminders exhausted -> admin refresh or replacement path
token accepted -> nomination recorded
all required nominations complete -> application moves to admin review
token expired/invalid/wrong user/replaced -> safe error and retry/admin path
```

To verify: token fields, expiry, reminder counters, ownership checks, replaced
token rejection, and duplicate nomination prevention.

## Partner Invite Token Lifecycle (unregistered partner)

```text
create-group names an unregistered partner email -> single-use PartnerInviteToken minted (hashed at rest) + invite email
invitee opens claim link, not signed in -> routed to /join/apply (normal membership process), then back to the link
invitee signed in with a different email -> refused (invitation was sent to invitedEmail)
GROUP_CREATE not yet approved (group memberless) -> claim refused (group not available yet)
invitee signed in with the invited email, group approved -> ADULT_INVITE filed + accepted, token confirmedAt set (single use)
token expired -> claim refused; daily cron sweep hard-deletes expired rows
admin revokes -> token hard-deleted, claim link stops working
inviter cancels own declared-partner invitation from the profile Partner card (#1754) -> token hard-deleted (own createPartnerLink tokens, unclaimed only, audited)
```

To verify: hash-at-rest, single-use `confirmedAt` guard, email-match ownership
check, memberless-group refusal, expiry sweep idempotency, admin revocation,
and the member-side cancel scope (own, unclaimed, `createPartnerLink` only).

A token minted with `createPartnerLink` (#1742) additionally forms the
CONFIRMED `MemberPartnerLink` between inviter and claimer inside the claim
transaction — see Partner Link Lifecycle below. A business conflict skips the
link (audited) without failing the family-group join.

## Partner Link Lifecycle (declared Partner/Husband/Wife, #1742)

Known statuses: `PENDING`, `CONFIRMED`. Declined, withdrawn, and dissolved
links are hard-deleted (audit log keeps history), so the pair can re-form.

```text
member requests partner by email (registered login adult) -> PENDING + email to target
target confirms from profile -> CONFIRMED (one-confirmed-partner invariant re-checked under advisory lock; other PENDING requests involving either member pruned)
target declines -> row hard-deleted (no email), initiator may re-request
initiator withdraws own PENDING -> row hard-deleted
the adult recorded as having confirmed a NO-LOGIN adult co-member's details declares them -> CONFIRMED in one step (no consent round-trip; "one login manages the family"). Gated on Member.detailsConfirmedByMemberId naming the initiator AND the pair still sharing a family group (#2284 re-anchored this off the FamilyGroupMember.role ADMIN value, which #2520 then dropped from the database outright — there is no rank on a family membership to re-anchor onto); the voucher pointer is self-assignable by any adult login co-member, so this is an equal-adults gate, not a group-lead privilege
admin assigns directly (admin member-detail card) -> CONFIRMED immediately, assignedByAdminId recorded; an existing PENDING for the pair is promoted; both members emailed unless the admin chose not to notify (#1769a)
unregistered partner claims a createPartnerLink invite token -> CONFIRMED inside the claim transaction (claim = consent)
either CONFIRMED partner removes the link -> row hard-deleted, other partner emailed
admin removes any link -> row hard-deleted, both partners emailed when it was CONFIRMED unless the admin chose not to notify (#1769a); a PENDING removal emails no one
CONFIRMED link deleted (either dissolve path) -> pair's FUTURE shared double-bed second-occupant allocations swept back to the awaiting-allocation queue in the same transaction (#1756; both bookings audited, admins alerted post-commit)
member deactivated / anonymised / re-tiered off ADULT -> same sweep, single-member scope (either side of the shared bed)
CONFIRMED link DROPPED by a member merge (the master already had its one confirmed partner) -> the merge's own validity-driven reconciliation instead of the sweep above (#2595): every future shared bed-night involving the master or the duplicate is re-judged against mayShareDoubleBedWith and only the ones that no longer qualify are swept, so the master's own still-confirmed share survives
```

To verify: canonical pair ordering (`memberAId < memberBId` CHECK), the
one-CONFIRMED-partner-per-member invariant (advisory locks + partial unique
indexes), ADULT-only + no-self-partner guards, pending pruning on confirm,
one outstanding outgoing request per member, the memberId-target
shared-family-group guard on the member API, and the stale-share sweep
invariant (#1756, extended to merge by #2595): no future `isSecondOccupant`
allocation may outlive its partner link or the active-adult precondition (see
`INV-CAP-010` for the #1756 sweep and `INV-CAP-030` for the merge form, both in
docs/invariants/booking-dates-and-capacity.md).

## Member Guest Consent Lifecycle ("+ Add Member Guest", #2305 / MG2 #2307, MG4 #2309)

Known `BookingGuest.consentStatus` values: `null`, `PENDING`, `CONFIRMED`,
`DECLINED`, `EXPIRED`. **`null` is the dominant state and always will be** —
every non-member guest, every family-scope guest (owner decision D-6), every row
written before this feature existed. `null` is *consent-free*, not
*consent-given*, and the two must stay distinguishable forever: `CONFIRMED`
means somebody said yes, `null` means nobody had to be asked.

```text
add, module ON, cross-family, member acting, approvalRequired=true (the shipped default, D-3)
    -> PENDING + consentRequestedAt + consentExpiresAt = min(now + N days, the day before check-in), floored at +2h; the target or their delegate is emailed
add, module ON, cross-family, member acting, approvalRequired=false (notify-only opt-down)
    -> CONFIRMED with NULL requestedAt/respondedAt/respondedBy/expiresAt ("auto-confirmed, never asked"); the target is told, not asked
add, module ON, cross-family, ADMIN acting (on-behalf, admin booking-copy, pipeline)
    -> CONFIRMED + consentRespondedAt + consentRespondedByMemberId = the acting admin (MG4-D-a, brought forward); always notify
add, family scope, or module OFF
    -> all five columns NULL (D-6, unchanged; module OFF refuses a cross-family add with the byte-for-byte pre-feature error)
booking copy of an existing cross-family guest
    -> re-stamped against the copying admin; consent is NOT transitive across bookings

PENDING -> CONFIRMED   the target, or a delegate the resolver accepts (D-5/D-10); respondedAt + respondedBy recorded; bed allocations reconciled post-commit
PENDING -> DECLINED    same actors; then the SHARED removal path (never a second delete)
PENDING -> EXPIRED     the nightly sweep, when now >= consentExpiresAt; then the shared removal path, electing account credit (D-15); respondedBy stays NULL because nobody decided
CONFIRMED              terminal. D-13: no later modification of the booking re-opens it, in either policy mode
DECLINED / EXPIRED     terminal, and normally GONE — see below

any state -> (row deleted)   the booker or an officer takes the guest off the booking, or the
                             booking-request approval substitutes somebody else onto the row.
                             The member is told once (member-guest-request-withdrawn); the
                             consent record goes with the row. NOT a status transition.
```

**A soft-deleted booking answers nothing at all, and that outranks every
PENDING edge above** (#2700, `INV-ADDPAY-035`). `respondToMemberGuestConsent`
refuses before any transition is attempted, for **every** actor — the target and
an accepted delegate alike — so `PENDING -> CONFIRMED` and `PENDING -> DECLINED`
are both unreachable once the club has deleted the booking. Nothing is recorded:
no claim, no bed reconcile, no hosting-queue drain, and no email to the booking
owner about a record the club has deleted. The refusal is asserted twice — once
unlocked to answer cheaply, and again inside the transaction under
`pg_advisory_xact_lock(1)`, which is the same key `softDeleteCancelledBooking`
takes, so a deletion committing between the two reads is serialised behind the
consent transaction and seen. The nightly `PENDING -> EXPIRED` sweep is
unaffected; it is not an answer.

**No EDIT transitions this machine, and that is owner decision D-13 rather than
an omission.** Changing a booking's dates, its lodge, its price, or the rest of
its party leaves every consent column of an already-consented guest exactly as
it was — not rewritten to the same value, but never touched. There is no
`CONFIRMED -> PENDING` edge and no re-consent path anywhere in the edit,
modify-quote, modify-plan, copy or pipeline code, and a test asserts the
absence rather than the presence. So a booker may stretch a two-night stay a
member agreed to into a ten-night one and that member is neither asked nor told;
their only exit is self-removal, which D-14 may itself refuse. The two ticks
compound, and the compound outcome is stated here and in
`docs/DOMAIN_INVARIANTS.md` so a reader meets it as a decision rather than as a
surprise.

**Leaving the machine is not the same as moving inside it.** A guest row can
disappear at any state — the booker removes them, an officer withdraws a request
nobody has answered, the booking-request approval swaps a different member onto
the row — and none of that is a status transition, because the row and its five
columns are deleted together. What the member gets is one message saying they are
no longer on the booking, from whichever surface did it. A decline and a lapse
are the two cases that do NOT use it: each already has its own message for the
same event, and sending both would give one person two explanations.

**Every transition is a status-guarded `updateMany`** (`WHERE id = ? AND
consentStatus = 'PENDING'`). A zero row count means somebody else won, and then
there is **no email, no removal, no bed write, no audit entry** — which is what
makes double-approve, approve-after-expire, decline-racing-the-sweep and two
delegates answering at once all resolve to one winner and one set of effects.

**Why `DECLINED` and `EXPIRED` rows are usually invisible.** The shared removal
path deletes the guest row, so a successful decline leaves no `DECLINED` row
behind; the durable record is the audit entry and the outcome email. The
persisted status earns its keep in exactly one case: **the claim succeeded but the
removal was refused.** That row is *blocked* — still holding a bed, needing a
human — and appears on the admin exception list. Owner decision **D-14** makes
this reachable on purpose: the ordinary self-removal blockers apply to a member
who never consented, so a decline can be refused. Owner decision **D-15** keeps
the list short by electing account credit on the sweep, so an ordinary paid
booking always releases; only four reasons reach the list (last guest,
quote-priced, a status that forbids guest changes, check-in already started).

**A refused removal is TWO writes, and it has to be.** The shared removal path
deletes the guest's chore assignments and the guest row *before* its last two
gates run, so a refusal caught inside the transaction and returned as a value
would let Prisma commit a half-completed removal — the row gone, the price never
recalculated, no credit, no bed reconcile, and no blocked row for the exception
list to show. The refusal is therefore THROWN out of the transaction, which rolls
all of that back, and the terminal status is written afterwards by a separate,
minimal transaction over the row the rollback restored. That second write reuses
the same status-guarded claim, so a sweep that legitimately claimed the row in
between wins and the caller reports `ALREADY_RESOLVED` with no side effects.

To verify: the status-guarded claim in `member-guest-consent-service.ts` (a bare
`update` by id breaks a concurrency test); the two-lock order (global
`pg_advisory_xact_lock(1)` for money/status, THEN the per-lodge capacity lock);
read-key → lock → re-read, including the sweep's re-assertion of
`consentExpiresAt` on the fresh row under the lock; the expiry clamp landing on
the day BEFORE check-in (clamping to check-in itself would fire on a morning the
removal path already refuses as `STAY_NOT_FUTURE`); the `consentAuthority`
parameter authorizing exactly one guest id and only once that row already carries
its terminal status; and `OPERATIONALLY_PRESENT_GUEST_WHERE`, which must match
`null` and `CONFIRMED` and nothing else (see docs/DOMAIN_INVARIANTS.md, "Member
guest consent").

## Lodge Induction Lifecycle

Known induction statuses: `DRAFT`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `COMPLETED`, `VOIDED`.
Known workflow kinds: `NEW_MEMBER`, `HUT_LEADER`, `YOUTH_TO_FULL`,
`RE_INDUCTION`.

```text
admin/application creates induction -> assigned signers review checklist
signer records overall Pass -> sign-off count increments
required sign-offs reached -> COMPLETED
admin override -> COMPLETED
trusted legacy baseline -> NEW_MEMBER COMPLETED (ADMIN_OVERRIDE)
admin void -> VOIDED
```

Checklist templates are versioned and active per workflow kind, so a Hut Leader
Induction can use different checklist wording from a New Member Induction.
The trusted legacy baseline transition is the guarded, dry-run-first exception
for an authorised pre-register history (#2361). It creates a new row only for
an active, non-archived, non-cancelled real-member row (`USER` or `ADMIN`) in a
configured person age tier who has neither an open workflow nor a completed
induction of any kind. Login is not required, so non-login dependants remain
included; `LODGE`, `NON_MEMBER`, and `SCHOOL` rows are excluded. It preserves
all existing rows and creates no signers or sign-offs. All new rows use the
same supplied, non-future New Zealand date for `inductionDate` and
`completedAt`, record the Full Admin actor and stable provenance, and commit
atomically. An open `DRAFT` or `IN_PROGRESS` row visible under the direct-DML
table lock blocks the entire apply; a repeat apply is a no-op. The required
operator freeze protects the wider member population from the final dry run
through apply. `N/A` members are reported but never transitioned.

Completing a `HUT_LEADER` induction sets the member's hut-leader eligibility
flag. Actual `HutLeaderAssignment` rows remain separate dated roster/coverage
records and are not created by induction completion.

`HutLeaderAssignment` has **no state machine of its own** and gains none from
the custodian bed hold (#2286): it stays a stateless dated record whose
Upcoming / Active / Past reading is derived from `startDate`/`endDate` against
today. Adding, changing or clearing its optional `bedId` is a plain field edit —
the held bed is computed from the row on every query, so shortening, extending
or deleting the assignment returns the bed with nothing to reconcile.

## Membership Cancellation, Archive, And Delete Lifecycle

Known request statuses: `REQUESTED`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, `WITHDRAWN`,
`COMPLETED`.
Known participant statuses: `REQUESTED`, `PENDING_CONFIRMATION`, `DECLINED`,
`APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, `CANCELLED`, `REJOINED`.
Known lifecycle action statuses: `REQUESTED`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`.

```text
cancellation requested -> participant confirmations -> admin review
admin approves -> local account/family changes -> Xero cancellation queued -> completed
admin rejects/withdraws -> request closed without lifecycle mutation
archive/delete requested -> second-admin review -> approved/rejected
delete approval -> eligibility re-check -> hard delete only when safe
```

Surfacing (#1938): ARCHIVE requests are reviewed on
`/admin/membership-cancellations`; DELETE requests are reviewed in the
"Admin-initiated deletion requests" section of `/admin/deletion-requests`. Both
badge the sidebar. The DELETE review enforces separation of duties — a
different admin than the requester must approve/reject (server 403 on
self-review); the queue disables the requester's own buttons to make the rule
visible. The list API (`/api/admin/member-lifecycle-action-requests`) takes an
`action` of `ARCHIVE` (default) or `DELETE` and maps the page-filter status
`PENDING` onto the lifecycle `REQUESTED` state.

Entry eligibility (#2383, #2391): a cancellation request — raised by an admin
from the member page, or by the member themselves from the **Membership
Cancellation** panel in their own profile — is accepted for any account holder
— every member whatever admin access they hold, and organisation/school
accounts — and refused only for the lodge kiosk device login and
booking-request contact records, which hold no membership. The kiosk is
recognised by the record's whole classification, so a person who merely also
holds the lodge tools stays cancellable. One rule,
`isMembershipHolderRecord`, shared by three call sites: the admin-raised server
route, the admin member page's gate, and (since #2391) the member-raised route
in `loadCancellationCandidates`, which applies it both to the requester and to
every candidate in the family list. The member-raised route adds exactly two
further conditions, and they are about being able to operate your own profile
rather than about the class of account: the requester must be `active` and
`canLogin`. Approval is where
the admin-account guards bite: a privileged target needs a Full Admin approver,
and the last active login-enabled Full Admin can never be cancelled, both
evaluated inside the approval transaction. A self-raised cancellation is
allowed but cannot be self-approved — including one raised from the profile
panel, where the requester is recorded as the member themselves. See
[`membership-lifecycle.md`](invariants/membership-lifecycle.md) and
[`CANCELLATIONS.md`](CANCELLATIONS.md#who-can-be-cancelled).

Approval blockers (#2392): `loadMembershipCancellationBlockersByMemberId` is the
single entry point for "why can this not be approved yet", and it now answers in
two parts — future owned bookings / guest appearances (local), and unpaid Xero
invoices on the member's contact. The invoice half runs only when
`xeroArchiveContactsOnCancellation` is on AND the member has a linked
`xeroContactId`, because those are exactly the conditions under which approval
archives a Xero contact; otherwise no Xero call is made. That setting is read
through `loadMembershipCancellationSettingsStrict`, so a failed read is an
unknown (the check runs) rather than a silent "off" (the check is skipped) —
the ordinary loader degrades to defaults whose archive flag is false. "Unpaid" means
AUTHORISED or SUBMITTED with `AmountDue > 0` (the finance dashboard's own open-
invoice definition), across ACCREC and ACCPAY, minus the member's current-season
subscription invoice when the approval is itself STILL about to credit it IN
FULL — mirroring `queueApprovedMembershipCancellationXeroOperations`, which would
otherwise deadlock the ordinary unpaid-subscription cancellation. That predicate
is `excusesUnpaidInvoiceBlocker` from
`loadMembershipCancellationSubscriptionCreditPlansByMemberId` (#2400), the same
module the credit note consults, so the exclusion set is exactly the set the
approval clears: an invoice that will NOT be credited — because it still covers
other members who have not been cancelled, or because its credit-note operation
has already had its single run and skipped — blocks like any other, or the
archive would take a Xero contact with a live balance out of circulation. The
recorded-outcome half is what makes the archive re-check safe: by the time it
runs the credit note has settled, so recomputing "would this credit in full?"
would answer yes for a whole cancelled family and excuse an invoice nobody is
going to credit (#2400 review). If Xero cannot be
reached the check FAILS CLOSED: the participant gets an
`invoice_check_unavailable` blocker (`disconnected` / `rate_limited` /
`unavailable` / `invalid_request` / `too_many_invoices`) and the approval is
refused, because an unknown answer is not "nothing owing". `invalid_request`
(Xero 400/404 — usually a contact merged or deleted there) and
`too_many_invoices` are the NON-transient ones and are worded as such; every
failure message names the archive-setting escape hatch. Contact ids are chunked
40 to a `getInvoices` call, and hitting the `MAX_INVOICE_PAGES` cap raises
`too_many_invoices` for the batch rather than returning a truncated list — Xero
orders a batched read `DueDate ASC` across all its contacts, so a truncated
result could otherwise leave a quiet contact looking clear. The review queue
reads through a 60s in-process memo; the approval guard always passes
`freshInvoiceCheck` so a decision is never taken on a cached answer, and
failures are never memoised. Because the archive is an outbox operation drained
later, `syncXeroMembershipCancellationContact` re-runs the same check `fresh`
immediately before archiving and DEFERS (fails for retry, like the credit-note
guard) if anything is owing. The QUEUE RENDER is additionally scoped (#2402):
`getAdminMembershipCancellationRequests` asks about participants satisfying
`isMembershipCancellationParticipantAwaitingApproval`
(`membership-cancellation-approval-readiness.ts`) — the conjunction of both
approval guards' own preconditions, held in agreement with them by test, and the
same predicate the queue page's Approve button is enabled off, so the button is
never live on a row whose check did not run. The BOOKING half loads for that set
regardless of viewer. The INVOICE half additionally requires
`viewerCanApprove`, which the route resolves from the same `membership: edit`
requirement the review endpoint enforces, and is declined via
`loadMembershipCancellationBlockersByMemberId`'s `invoiceCheck: "skip"` (default
`"run"`, so omission is fail-closed). A declined participant is serialized with
`invoiceCheckSkipped: true` so the queue states that the money check did not run
rather than rendering an absent panel that reads as "nothing owing"; the
shared-invoice notice and its credit-plan read are skipped with it, because its
`blocksApproval` field is derived from the invoice blockers. Approval and
archive-time checks are unaffected. See
[`CANCELLATIONS.md`](CANCELLATIONS.md#unpaid-invoices-block-approval).

Shared subscription invoices (#2400): one Xero invoice covers every member of a
family or billing group, and `xero-subscription-invoices.ts` stamps its id on
each covered `MemberSubscription`. `createXeroMembershipCancellationCreditNote`
credits `amountDue` — the WHOLE remaining balance — so it now raises the note
only when the leaver is the last covered member still with the club. "Covered"
is the union of the subscription invoice link and the charge's ACTIVE
(`releasedAt IS NULL`) coverage claims, because those two records can disagree
and an uncertain covered set must not authorise wiping a balance; a covered
member drops out of it once `Member.cancelledAt` is set, so approving a whole
family one participant at a time leaves the LAST approval to credit the invoice
in full. Otherwise the operation completes SUCCEEDED with
`skipped: shared_invoice_covers_remaining_members` and no Xero call is made at
all — the check runs before the client is authenticated, and after the
existing-credit-note lookup, so a partially-completed run still finishes its
allocation. The determination is made afresh at each moment it is acted on
(approval gate, then the credit note itself), never snapshotted at request time.

Once that gate passes, the run takes a durable per-INVOICE claim before its first
Xero call (`XeroObjectLink`, role
`MEMBERSHIP_CANCELLATION_CREDIT_INVOICE_CLAIM`, inserted with `skipDuplicates`),
because several siblings' cancellations can reach the same "nobody else is
covered" state and the outbox claims per operation, not per invoice. A run that
loses the claim performs no Xero call and completes SUCCEEDED with
`skipped: invoice_credit_claimed_by_other_cancellation`; the holder's own retries
proceed. Where a cancellation credits nothing AND no member the invoice covers is
left with the club — the whole-family case whose last leaver has a PAID
subscription — the operation records `sharedInvoiceLeftUncredited` and an admin
alert names the invoice, so a balance nobody will ever credit is not left silent.
See [`CANCELLATIONS.md`](CANCELLATIONS.md#shared-family-invoices) and
[`CONCURRENCY_AND_LOCKING.md`](CONCURRENCY_AND_LOCKING.md).

To verify: financial blockers, future booking blockers, family cleanup, Xero
group/archive behavior, and email visibility.

Direct import into the cancelled end-state (#1946): the admin member CSV import
accepts an optional **Cancelled Date** column. A row with a cancelled date is
created directly as a cancelled member — `active = false`, `canLogin = false`,
`cancelledAt` = the given NZ date-only value, `cancelledReason` and
`cancelledViaRequestId` null (no `MembershipCancellationRequest` exists for a
legacy import). This produces the same terminal member fields the normal
approval transition writes, minus side effects: the import sends no cancellation
email and queues no Xero cancellation operation (a freshly imported member has
no Xero contact to cancel), and never sends a setup invite. A cancelled import
row does not claim the login for a shared email (an active member keeps it), and
a cancelled date in the future is rejected (mirrors the flow's `cancelledAt =
now`). Because the import only ever creates members and skips a row whose
email+name identity already exists, it cannot cancel an existing active member —
that remains an admin cancellation-flow action, with its blockers, confirmations,
and Xero handling. The import establishes no family links, so there is no
cross-row cancellation cascade between a cancelled primary and active family
rows in the same file; each row's status is independent.

## Family And Dependent Lifecycle

```text
family group created -> dependents/adults linked
adult invitation/request -> pending -> accepted/rejected
member creates group -> memberless FamilyGroup + PENDING GROUP_CREATE (+ bundled child requests) -> admin approve (ADMIN membership created, partner ADULT_INVITE auto-filed) | reject (bundle cascade-rejected, group stays inert)
create-group names an unregistered partner email -> single-use PartnerInviteToken minted + emailed (see Partner Invite Token Lifecycle) instead of an invitedMemberId
create-group marks the named partner as a declared partner (#1742) -> registered partner gets a PENDING MemberPartnerLink request; unregistered partner's token carries createPartnerLink (see Partner Link Lifecycle)
dependent inherits email or has explicit email inheritance source
parent link requested -> parent is active + not archived + not an organisation account (ANY age tier) -> ancestors(parent) + 1 + descendants(child) <= 3 links -> linked | 422 (parent inactive/archived/organisation) | 422 (four-generation cap) | 422 (would close a family loop)
dependent inherits email -> the chosen parent themselves, if adult + not archived + not cancelled + real address + not themselves inheriting -> record that parent as the CHOICE and derive the effective pointer from it | 422 (that parent cannot receive club mail). One hop only since #2716: no walk, and no fallback to a grandparent.
family removal/cancellation/delete -> relationship cleanup while preserving history
cancellation approved for a middle generation -> its dependants' links cleared, NOT re-parented -> detached members named in the response and the audit log
```

A `CHILD_REQUEST` whose family group still has zero memberships (a bundled
group-creation child) cannot be approved until the `GROUP_CREATE` request for
that group is approved first (422 guard).

A parent link may be recorded at **any age tier** (#2282): a 16 or 17 year old
can genuinely be a parent, so recording the relationship is age-blind while
every responsibility function — the contact of record for a dependant's mail,
details confirmation, booking delegation — stays gated on an active adult, none
of which consults the parent link. A dependant of a non-adult parent therefore
inherits from **nobody** (#2716) — the address does not travel past them to a
grandparent — and the admin member page says so before the dependant is added. Organisation and school ACCOUNTS are
the one exclusion, and it is by role rather than by age tier: they are not
people, and `NOT_APPLICABLE` is the age-exempt tier that age-exempt humans carry
too.

Family links run to at most **four generations** (great-grandparent →
grandparent → parent → child) and two parents per member, checked symmetrically
at link time so the verdict does not depend on the order links were created in.
See `docs/DOMAIN_INVARIANTS.md` → parent/dependant links for the rule, the
writers that enforce it, and the direct-parent-only email inheritance that goes
with it (`INV-LIFE-047`).

To verify: non-login adult confirmation, dependent age-up behavior, inherited
email changes, the four-generation cap and its cycle guard at depth, and Xero
contact synchronization.

## Email Retry Lifecycle

Known email log statuses: `QUEUED`, `SENT`, `FAILED`, `BOUNCED`,
`SKIPPED_NO_EMAILS`, `SKIPPED_NON_PRODUCTION`.

`SKIPPED_NON_PRODUCTION` (#3035) is the environment-safety suppression: this
installation is a confirmed copy, so nothing was transmitted and no provider was
contacted. It is TERMINAL and the retry cron never selects it — that job filters
on `FAILED` alone. An installation whose role nobody has declared, and a live
installation that has declared a local capture mailbox, both land on `FAILED`
instead, carrying a `deliveryBlockReason`: those are configuration faults, so they
stay retryable and go out by themselves once the deployment is corrected —
PROVIDED the row still holds a rendered body. It does not for the twenty-six
`SENSITIVE_EMAIL_LOG_TEMPLATES`, nor for any message whose logged recipient is
redacted, because a live sign-in link, a door code or a payment link must not sit
at rest; and the retry cron selects only rows that still hold one. Such a row is
therefore written AT `attempts = 3`, which drops it out of the retry query and
into the operator's email-failure review queue for a manual re-send, and its
`errorMessage` says exactly that rather than promising it will self-heal.
A copy that has explicitly declared a capture mailbox transmits into it normally
and its rows are ordinary `SENT`.

```text
email queued -> send attempted -> sent
confirmed copy -> environment-safety suppression (terminal, no provider contacted)
unconfirmed role or capture-in-production -> retryable failure carrying a block reason
send failure -> retryable failed -> suppression + booking authority rechecked
current authority + current mailbox -> delivery HTML re-finalized -> guarded claim -> retried by cron
revoked authority or stale mailbox -> detail CTA removed, bearer/page action preserved -> retried
unknown legacy authority -> retired for manual review
application rollback -> old worker cannot select quarantined new-version booking body
exhausted or suppressed -> admin-visible failure/suppression
```

To verify: retry backoff, suppression handling, durable recipient identity,
direct/inherited mailbox drift, revoked-authority fail-closed behavior,
page-fragment/bearer preservation, rollback isolation, which business-critical
emails require admin alerts, and that the four reasons a message went unsent —
the club's own "No emails" switch, an environment-safety suppression, an
unconfirmed environment, and a provider failure — stay distinguishable
(INV-CONFIG-004).

## Xero Outbox And Reconciliation Lifecycle

```text
local business event -> Xero outbox operation queued
worker claims operation -> provider call -> success or retryable failure
inbound webhook/event recorded -> reconciliation worker processes event
failure -> retry/backoff/admin visibility
```

To verify: status strings, stale processing reset, tenant selection, link
cleanup, and exact retry exhaustion alerts.

## Cron And Recovery Lifecycle

```text
cron request authenticated by CRON_SECRET -> task allowlist/module gate
task records run/claim -> processes due rows
success -> durable state updated
failure -> run/failure visible and retryable where business-critical
```

To verify: which cron jobs record `CronJobRun`, exact statuses, stale queue
health thresholds, and skipped-module reporting.

## Two-Factor Login Lifecycle

```text
password accepted -> JWT session issued with twoFactorVerified=false
module off -> session treated verified for normal routing
module on + unenrolled -> protected layout redirects to /login/enroll
module on + enrolled -> protected layout redirects to /login/verify
valid TOTP/email/recovery code -> server mints single-use challenge token (hashed, short TTL)
session update carrying that token -> jwt callback consumes it -> twoFactorVerified=true
client-forged session update without a valid token -> ignored, session stays unverified
invalid attempts -> per-member counter increments -> 15 minute lockout after 5 failures
```

To verify: Auth.js JWT callback claim handling, challenge-token single-use
consumption, protected route-group layout redirects, API guard rejection,
email-code expiry, TOTP skew window, recovery code single-use consumption, and
lockout reset after successful verification.

## Magic-Link Sign-In Lifecycle

Passwordless email sign-in (issue #2034, epic #2030). Additive to password
login, module-gated (`magicLink`, default off), and never an email-verification
bypass. The token is a single-use, SHA-256-hashed `MagicLinkToken` (the same
primitive as password reset).

```text
member requests link (POST /api/auth/magic-link) -> ALWAYS {success:true} (enumeration-safe)
  module off, unknown, canLogin=false, inactive, or unverified -> silent no-op, zero email
  module on + active + verified -> old tokens deleted, one fresh token minted, link emailed (magic-link-login, sensitive-log redacted)
click /login/magic?token=… -> signIn("magic-link") verify provider:
  bad format / missing / used / expired token -> rejected (generic failure)
  conditional claim updateMany({id, used:false}) count===1 -> claimed (two concurrent clicks -> at most one session)
  member gate: canLogin && active (else reject); unverified -> EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED; forcePasswordChange -> refuse, point to Forgot password
  success -> JWT issued with twoFactorVerified=false (2FA member still routed to /login/verify)
TTL: read from LoginSecuritySetting.magicLinkTtlMinutes (#2033) via loadLoginSecuritySettings(), default 15, clamped 5..60
```

To verify: enumeration safety (4 no-op cases + zero email), module-off no-op,
the conditional-claim single-use race, expired/tampered rejection, the
archived/dependent and forcePasswordChange refusals, the unverified block, that
the emailed link's HTML never persists in `EmailLog`, and that a 2FA-enrolled
member still lands on `/login/verify`.

## Google Sign-In Lifecycle (profile-initiated linking)

Google OAuth sign-in (issue #2035, epic #2030). JWT strategy, NO adapter.
Additive to password login, module-gated (`googleLogin`, default off, plus
`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`). **Profile-initiated linking only** —
no account is ever created from Google, and login never matches by email
(closes the Workspace-domain takeover). Sign-in resolves a member solely by the
pinned subject id `Member.googleSub`. The single Google provider serves both
login and linking; the `signIn` callback disambiguates via a short-lived,
HttpOnly, HMAC-signed link-intent cookie set by the authenticated
`POST /api/profile/google/link/start`.

```text
LINK (signed-in member, profile > Connected accounts > Connect Google):
  POST /api/profile/google/link/start -> sets signed link-intent cookie (binds memberId), then signIn("google")
  Google OAuth round-trip -> signIn callback sees the intent cookie:
    module off -> refuse -> /profile?googleError=disabled
    email_verified !== true -> refuse -> /profile?googleError=unverified
    sub already linked to ANOTHER member -> refuse (audited) -> /profile?googleError=already_linked
    member already linked to a DIFFERENT sub -> refuse (audited) -> /profile?googleError=account_conflict
    else -> pin Member.googleSub = profile.sub (audited, security), RETURN redirect STRING
            -> Auth.js redirects BEFORE minting a session (no identity switch) -> /profile?googleLinked=1
UNLINK: POST /api/profile/google/unlink -> googleSub = null (audited); password login always remains

LOGIN (/login "Continue with Google", shown only when module on + creds present):
  Google OAuth round-trip -> provider profile() resolves by googleSub === profile.sub (login-capable only):
    no match -> unlinked -> /login?error=google_unlinked (NEVER email-match, NEVER provision)
    inactive or unverified -> refused -> /login?error=google_refused
    forcePasswordChange -> /login?error=google_password_change
    resolver throws (DB error mid-resolve) -> failed (fail-closed sentinel) -> /login?error=google_failed
    eligible -> same user shape as password login -> lastLoginAt bumped
  signIn callback: module off -> /login?error=google_disabled (even for linked members)
    lastLoginAt bump hits P2025 (member row gone -> id would dangle) -> refuse -> /login?error=google_failed
    eligible -> allow -> JWT issued with twoFactorVerified=false (2FA member still routed to /login/verify)
  jwt callback (every request): token.id resolves to NO member row -> sessionInvalidated=true
    -> auth() reads null everywhere -> single redirect to /login rendering the form
       (breaks the /dashboard<->/login loop for dangling sessions; #2229)
```

To verify: sub-path sign-in; the email-match-without-link refusal (takeover
regression — no auto-link, no provision); the unverified-email link block; the
link/unlink/re-link audited flows; the sub-already-linked-to-another and
member-already-linked refusals; archived/dependent/forcePasswordChange refusals
even when linked; the module kill-switch in both directions; that a linked
2FA-enrolled member still lands on `/login/verify`; that a resolver throw or a
dangling member id refuses/invalidates instead of minting a session (#2229);
and that every refusal renders a visible friendly message via the
`/login?error=…` wiring.

## Analytics Consent Lifecycle

Client-side state machine for GA4 consent (issue #975, reshaped by #2573). The
module must be enabled AND a valid GA4 measurement id must be stored in
`AnalyticsSettings` before anything renders at all, and the route must also be
analytics-eligible before the BANNER or the TAG appears. There is no
environment-variable path.

Route eligibility gates the banner and the tag; it deliberately does **not** gate
the public **Analytics preferences** control, which is offered wherever the runtime
is mounted — including a public page analytics does not run on — because in
banner-off mode it is the visitor's only way to opt out.

The club chooses one of two modes at Admin → Integrations → Google Analytics.

Banner ENABLED (the default, and the recommended option):

```text
no stored choice, or one stored under an older consent revision
    -> banner shown; NOTHING sent to Google (no tag, no request, no ping, no consent signal)
visitor accepts  -> {choice:"accepted", revision, source:"banner"} persisted -> loader renders, analytics_storage granted
visitor declines -> {choice:"declined", revision, source:"banner"} persisted -> loader never renders
visitor dismisses (close) -> identical to declining
stored choice at the CURRENT revision -> banner suppressed, prior choice honoured
admin runs "Ask visitors to choose again" -> revision bumped -> every stored choice is stale -> banner shown again
```

Banner DISABLED:

```text
no stored choice                        -> loader renders automatically, analytics_storage granted
stored choice with source:"banner"      -> IGNORED once (a banner-era decline no longer blocks) -> loader renders
stored choice with source:"preferences" -> HONOURED at any revision (accepted -> loads, declined -> does not)
visitor opts out from the footer's Analytics preferences control
    -> {choice:"declined", revision, source:"preferences"} persisted
    -> consent update denied + window["ga-disable-<ID>"] set -> no further collection
```

Advertising storage, advertising user data and advertising personalisation are
denied in every signal, in both modes.

To verify: no `<Script>` at all while the banner is enabled and unanswered; the
loader rendering only when module enabled + valid stored measurement id +
eligible route + decision allows; decline and dismiss both mapping to denied; a
revision bump re-prompting; a banner-era decline being ignored in banner-off mode
while a preferences decline is not; and `send_page_view: false` with exactly one
sanitised `origin + pathname` page view per client-side navigation.

## Site Banner Display Lifecycle

Site banners (issue #994) travel a date-window lifecycle plus a per-browser
dismissal state.

```text
upcoming -> current -> past   (inclusive NZ date-only startDate..endDate window)
active toggle off -> hidden regardless of window
visitor dismisses -> hidden in that browser (localStorage site-banners.dismissed.v1)
admin edits the banner -> updatedAt changes -> dismissal invalidated, banner re-shown
```

To verify: the admin page's current/upcoming/past split, the inclusive
date-only comparison in NZ time, and dismissal invalidation keyed on
`updatedAt`.
