# Xero Handoff

Last updated: 2026-04-14

This document replaces the previous Xero audit and reconciliation review docs. It is intended to be the single handoff for the next agent.

## Goal

Finish the remaining Xero work so TACBookings:

- stays comfortably below the 1000-calls-per-day Xero limit
- uses incremental sync and webhook-driven reconciliation instead of full scans
- keeps admin and member read paths local-only wherever practical
- preserves durable, replayable, auditable outbound and inbound Xero operations

## Current Baseline

Treat the following as already implemented unless there is a specific reason to change them:

- shared metered Xero wrapper and admin usage dashboard
- durable outbound operation ledger and object-link storage
- durable primary-write outbox for:
  - entrance-fee invoices
  - booking invoices
  - standard refund credit notes
  - unapplied account-credit notes
  - booking-modification supplementary invoices
  - booking-modification credit notes
- retry, requeue, and record-scoped Xero activity surfaces for supported outbound failures
- stored inbound-event persistence, replay, and linked-record reconciliation for:
  - `CONTACT`
  - `INVOICE`
  - `PAYMENT`
  - `CREDIT_NOTE`
- steady-state contact-link trust plus inline stale-contact repair for contact-dependent writes
- durable shared cache for admin chart-of-accounts and items reference data
- durable incremental membership invoice sync cursor with `If-Modified-Since` and retry carry-forward
- local-only member subscription status reads
- durable local cache tables for Xero contact groups and group memberships, plus operator-triggered refresh

## Recommended Execution Order

Build in this order:

1. Phase 4: incremental contact sync and group import
2. Phase 7 remaining reconciliation work
3. Phase 6 remaining outbox / repair decisions
4. Hardening, drift detection, and any new `PARTIAL` support
5. Phase 8 cleanup audit

## Completed In This Pass

### Phase 2: Replace full membership polling with incremental invoice sync

Implemented:

- added durable `XeroSyncCursor` state for the membership invoice sync window
- replaced full linked-member scans in `refreshAllMembershipStatuses()` with an incremental `getInvoices(..., If-Modified-Since=...)` pass scoped to the subscription season window
- mapped changed invoices back to local members through `Member.xeroContactId`
- carried failed/unfinished member refreshes forward on the cursor metadata instead of falling back to future full scans
- kept `checkMembershipStatus(...)` as the targeted repair/reconciliation path, but stopped unconditional `getOnlineInvoice(...)` fetches
- only refreshed online invoice URLs when first discovering a subscription invoice, when the matched subscription invoice changed, or when an explicit repair asks for it
- removed the member-facing `/api/member/subscription-status` fallback that read through to Xero on page load

Primary files updated:

- `src/lib/xero.ts`
- `src/app/api/member/subscription-status/route.ts`
- `prisma/schema.prisma`

### Phase 3: Move contact groups and group memberships to local cache tables

Implemented:

- added durable cache tables for Xero contact groups and group memberships
- made `/api/admin/xero/contact-groups` serve cache by default, with `?refresh=1` as the explicit operator-triggered refresh-from-Xero action
- moved `/api/admin/members` group filtering and list enrichment to local cache reads
- moved `/api/admin/members/[id]` group detail enrichment to local cache reads
- kept the existing feature-flag gate for member-page display, but the enabled path is now local-only instead of live Xero

Primary files updated:

- `src/lib/xero.ts`
- `src/app/api/admin/xero/contact-groups/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/admin/members/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/admin/members/[id]/route.ts`
- `src/app/(admin)/admin/xero/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(admin)/admin/members/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(admin)/admin/members/[id]/page.tsx`
- `prisma/schema.prisma`

### Phase 4: Make contact sync and group import incremental

Implemented:

- added a durable `CONTACT_SYNC` cursor and switched `syncContactsFromXero()` to incremental `getContacts(..., If-Modified-Since=...)` reads with retry carry-forward for failed contact records
- added durable `XeroContactCache` snapshots so changed contacts persist their current Xero email/name/status/phone/address fields plus `updatedDateUTC` locally
- stopped doing first-invoice lookups in the default contact sync path
- kept joined-date backfill available only as an explicit repair/backfill mode on the sync route (`POST /api/admin/xero/sync-contacts` with JSON flags such as `{"backfillJoinedDates":true}` and optionally `{"fullResync":true}`)
- reworked `importMembersFromXeroGroups()` to consume cached group membership and cached contact snapshots by default instead of refetching every group and contact live from Xero
- added explicit repair mode for cached import gaps (`repairMissingContactCache`) that fetches only missing contact snapshots, while keeping full group rescans on the existing explicit `contact-groups?refresh=1` path

Primary files updated:

- `src/lib/xero.ts`
- `src/app/api/admin/xero/sync-contacts/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/admin/xero/import-members/route.ts`
- `prisma/schema.prisma`

### Phase 7: Partial follow-on in this pass

Implemented:

- `CONTACT` inbound reconciliation now refreshes `XeroContactCache` as part of webhook/replay handling, so the new durable contact snapshot cache is no longer maintained only by operator-triggered contact sync

Primary files updated:

- `src/lib/xero-inbound-reconciliation.ts`

### Phase 7: Inbound reconciliation now drives membership-state catch-up

Implemented:

- added a shared inbound reconciliation cycle that drains stored Xero inbound events in batches instead of treating webhook follow-up as a single small batch
- made that reconciliation cycle run the existing durable incremental membership invoice cursor immediately after stored inbound events, so webhook/incremental reconcile is now the main driver for `MemberSubscription` state catch-up
- switched the webhook after-response worker to trigger the full inbound reconciliation cycle instead of only replaying one stored-events batch
- switched the 15-minute inbound cron/instrumentation path to run the same stored-event + incremental-membership cycle
- left the daily/manual membership refresh entrypoints in place as safety-net wrappers around the same incremental invoice cursor, instead of as the primary driver

Primary files updated:

- `src/lib/xero-inbound-reconciliation.ts`
- `src/app/api/webhooks/xero/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/cron/xero/route.ts`
- `src/instrumentation.ts`

### Phase 7: Contact-driven cache refresh now extends into cached group memberships

Implemented:

- added a shared contact-cache refresh helper that updates `XeroContactCache` and selectively refreshes cached Xero contact-group memberships from a changed contact snapshot when Xero includes `contactGroups`
- switched `CONTACT` inbound reconciliation to use that shared helper, so webhook/replay processing now refreshes touched contact-group membership cache rows and group counts without requiring an operator-triggered full group rescan
- switched incremental `syncContactsFromXero()` to use the same helper, so any contact-sync pass can keep touched group membership cache state warm alongside `XeroContactCache`
- kept `GET /api/admin/xero/contact-groups?refresh=1` as the deliberate full-rescan safety net for untouched groups, missed webhook drift, or cache seeding

Primary files updated:

- `src/lib/xero.ts`
- `src/lib/xero-inbound-reconciliation.ts`

### Phase 7: Inbound reconciliation now includes incremental contact-sync safety net

Implemented:

- extended the shared inbound reconciliation cycle to run the existing incremental `CONTACT_SYNC` cursor as a throttled safety-net step after stored inbound events and before membership reconciliation
- kept that contact-sync pass summarized/throttled so webhook bursts do not repeatedly re-run it, while the 15-minute inbound cron can still catch missed or non-webhook contact/group drift
- kept operator-triggered `sync-contacts` and full contact-group refresh as repair/safety-net tools, but they are no longer the only way to advance missed contact-cache or touched group-membership state

Primary files updated:

- `src/lib/xero-inbound-reconciliation.ts`

## Remaining Work

### 1. Phase 7 remaining: make webhook and incremental reconcile the main source of truth

Inbound reconciliation now drives the primary membership-state catch-up path, can selectively keep touched cached contact-group memberships current, and now includes a throttled incremental contact-sync safety net, but some local business state is still not advanced directly from inbound/incremental changes.

Required outcome:

- webhook-triggered reconciliation advances the remaining business state that still depends on polling beyond membership subscriptions
- any remaining operator/daily polling stays a safety net, not the primary reconciliation path

Implementation direction:

- extend business-state application beyond the current metadata/link/cache backfills, incremental contact/group maintenance, and membership cursor catch-up path
- add any remaining incremental pull jobs where webhooks alone are insufficient
- consider whether bulk replay/filtering improvements are needed on the admin Xero screen after the main reconciliation paths land

Primary files:

- `src/lib/xero-inbound-reconciliation.ts`
- `src/app/api/webhooks/xero/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/cron/xero/route.ts`
- `src/instrumentation.ts`

### 2. Phase 6 remaining: finish the outbox boundary decisions

Most Phase 6 write-path reduction is done. The open work is narrower now.

Required outcome:

- any future contact-dependent write path stays on the shared stale-contact repair helper
- operator-triggered refund/account-credit repair routes have a clear, consistent execution model

Implementation direction:

- decide whether future operator-triggered refund/account-credit repair routes should also enqueue onto the durable outbox or stay intentionally synchronous
- preserve existing crash-recovery guarantees for any new automatic outbound write path

Primary files:

- `src/lib/xero.ts`
- `src/lib/xero-operation-outbox.ts`
- `src/lib/xero-operation-retry.ts`

### 3. Hardening and supportability

Core reconciliation hardening exists, but richer drift detection is still open.

Required outcome:

- nightly reporting covers more than canonical-link gaps
- support workflows can identify meaningful local-vs-Xero business-state drift
- any future partial outbound flow is explicitly repairable

Implementation direction:

- extend reconciliation reporting into richer business-state drift detection
- optionally add Xero history notes or attachments only if they materially improve operator support
- for any new `PARTIAL` state:
  - add a deterministic repair handler in `src/lib/xero-operation-retry.ts`
  - add any required helper path in `src/lib/xero.ts`
  - add explicit replay-safety tests

### 4. Phase 8 cleanup

The chart/item cache work is done. Only the audit/cleanup portion remains.

Required outcome:

- no remaining direct Xero SDK call should bypass the shared metered wrapper without a deliberate reason

Implementation direction:

- audit remaining direct SDK calls outside the shared wrapper
- decide whether any other low-priority reference-data reads deserve the same durable cache treatment

## Verification Expectations

At minimum, each pass should run the most relevant targeted suites plus a full build before updating this file.

Typical commands:

- `npx prisma generate`
- targeted `npx eslint ...`
- targeted `npx vitest run ...`
- `npm run build`

## Notes For The Next Agent

- Phase 4 is now complete. The default operator path is: refresh cached contact groups only when needed, run incremental contact sync to keep `XeroContactCache` warm and refresh any touched group memberships, then run cached member import.
- Explicit repair tools now live on the same admin endpoints:
  - `POST /api/admin/xero/sync-contacts` with JSON flags for `fullResync` / `backfillJoinedDates`
  - `POST /api/admin/xero/import-members` with `repairMissingContactCache`
  - `GET /api/admin/xero/contact-groups?refresh=1` for a deliberate full group rescan
- Do not reopen already-completed Phase 6/7/8 work unless the remaining phases force a design change.
- Stored inbound `CONTACT` reconciliation and the shared inbound reconciliation cycle now maintain contact snapshots, touched cached group memberships, and throttled incremental contact drift catch-up. Full group refresh remains the deliberate full-rescan safety net.
- The next biggest budget win is still Phase 7: make stored inbound events and incremental reconcile the primary driver of the remaining local business state beyond memberships and contact/group cache state.
