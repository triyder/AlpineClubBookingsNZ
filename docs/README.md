# Documentation

This is the documentation hub for AlpineClubBookingsNZ. It is organised
**audience-first**: find your role below, follow its "Start here" path, then
branch into the reference and feature docs. Every document in `docs/` is
reachable from this page, directly or through a feature hub.

New to the docs? Read [`STYLE_GUIDE.md`](STYLE_GUIDE.md) to see how these pages
are written and structured, and [`COVERAGE_MATRIX.md`](COVERAGE_MATRIX.md) for
what is and is not yet documented per admin area.

## Members and guests

Using the club: members signing in to book a stay, and guests staying without a
login.

**Start here:** the [Member & Guest Guide](user-guide/README.md) — plain-English,
step-by-step guides for the public and member-facing side of the app (the
website, sign-in, your dashboard, the booking wizard, your profile). The
journeys:

- [Joining the club](user-guide/joining-the-club.md) — apply, get nominated,
  approved, and sign in for the first time.
- [Booking a stay](user-guide/booking-a-stay.md) — the booking wizard, member and
  non-member guests, and the Members First vs First Paid, First In hold policies.
- [Paying for your stay](user-guide/paying-for-your-stay.md) — card, internet
  banking, account credit, and split charges.
- [Managing your family & household](user-guide/managing-your-family.md) — family
  groups, dependents, and partners.
- [Managing your account](user-guide/your-account.md) — profile, email/password,
  two-factor, sign-in methods, notifications, and privacy/deletion.
- [The waitlist & offers](user-guide/waitlist-and-offers.md) — join a full night
  and accept an offer.
- [Changing or cancelling a booking](user-guide/changing-or-cancelling-a-booking.md)
  — changes, cancellations, refunds, and credit.

## New Adopters

Evaluating or configuring a fork for your own club.

**Start here, in order:**

1. [`../README.md`](../README.md) — product scope, stack, and quick setup.
2. [`IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) — configure a fork for
   your own club.
3. [`../CONFIGURATION.md`](../CONFIGURATION.md) — the environment and
   `config/club.json` reference.
4. [`../DEPLOYMENT.md`](../DEPLOYMENT.md) — read before putting a shared or
   production environment online. (This file lives at the repository root, not
   in `docs/`.)
5. [`UPGRADING.md`](UPGRADING.md) — how to take downstream releases into your
   fork.

Then skim [Developers](#developers) for the architecture and [Operators](#operators)
for the runbooks you will use once you are live.

## Operators

Running a live club: admins, treasurers, and committee members.

**Start here:** [`../DEPLOYMENT.md`](../DEPLOYMENT.md) for bootstrap and
blue/green deployment, then the runbook for whatever you are doing.

Per-area, task-focused **operator guides** (with screenshots) were produced under
issue #2050 on the foundation this hub establishes, and now cover every admin
area. See [`COVERAGE_MATRIX.md`](COVERAGE_MATRIX.md) for the per-admin-area

it is an optional module, off by default.

The operator guides now cover every admin area (all five #2050 batches have

and subject/body safety rules.
