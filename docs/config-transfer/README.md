# Configuration Export & Import (config transfer)

> Part of the [documentation hub](../README.md).

A full-admin tool that exports a club's configuration, site content, and lodge
setup as a single portable zip bundle, and imports such a bundle into another
(or the same) instance through a plan → resolve → apply flow.

Feature issue: hoppers99/AlpineClubBookingsNZ#22 (fork). Available to full
admins at **Admin → Setup & Configuration → Export & Import**
(`/admin/config-transfer`).

For the task-focused operator walkthrough (export categories, the
plan → resolve → apply import flow, write modes, and reseal), see the
[Export & Import operator guide](../guides/config-transfer.md). This page is the
deeper reference for what each category contains and the import safety model.

## Using it

- **Export:** tick the categories to include (door codes are opt-in), download a
  `.zip` bundle.
- **Import:** upload a bundle → a mandatory **dry-run** shows exactly what will
  be created/updated per entity (plus door-code, Xero-org, and any bundle
  integrity warnings) → choose a **write mode** and (optionally) untick
  categories or resolve renames → confirm to apply. The server takes a
  `pg_dump` backup first, then in ONE transaction takes the single-flight
  advisory lock, re-plans against in-lock state, refuses on any drift, and
  applies; success and refused/failed attempts are both audited. Ordinary
  categories **never delete**. The deliberate exception is the booking-policy
  category: it replaces the complete exported minimum-stay and adult-member
  hosting sets and previews every deletion before Apply. The pre-apply backup is
  the true rollback.
- **Validation blocks apply:** every row is strictly validated at plan time —
  malformed dates, unknown enum values, non-integer/negative money, and
  invalid or reserved page slugs (the same rules the admin page editor
  enforces) are **errors** (named by file, row, and field) that disable Apply
  until the bundle is fixed (edit → reseal → re-preview). Blank cells are
  legal only where merge mode keeps an existing value. The import never
  quietly writes less, or different data, than the file says. Page paths are
  derived from the slug (never trusted from the file), and page HTML —
  including the header — is stored sanitised, exactly like the admin editor.
  Page rows also enforce the admin editor's field caps (slug/title/caption/
  menu-title lengths, header and content HTML sizes, sort-order range — the
  shared `PAGE_CONTENT_LIMITS`) and its system-page protections: a bundle
  cannot hide a page the editor refuses to unpublish (system and built-in
  pages), and cannot move a system page's fixed menu order (re-importing the
  page's current order — an instance's own export — stays clean). A
  cross-instance transfer therefore errors on a system page (e.g. `home`) whose
  bundled sort order is neither the fixed order nor the target's current
  order — normalise the system pages' sort order on both instances first.
  Keyed site-content rows (the footer sections) enforce the same content-HTML
  size cap as their admin route (the shared `SITE_CONTENT_LIMITS`), and their
  key must be one of the recognised site-content keys (the shared
  `SITE_CONTENT_KEYS`, matching the admin route's enum) — an unknown key is a
  clean row error, never a Prisma enum exception.
- **Door codes:** the dry-run prominently names each lodge whose door code the
  import would set or change, and the audit records which lodges' codes were
  actually written (never the values). Reseal recomputes the bundle's
  door-code flag from the actual files.
- **Renames (match picker):** an unmatched season, chore template, or induction
  template offers a picker — *create new* (default) or *match an existing row*
  (declaring it renamed). Resolutions re-preview and are bound into the
  fingerprint.
- **Import category selection:** untick any of the bundle's categories at
  preview to import a subset (e.g. skip Xero config after a cross-org
  warning); the selection re-previews and is fingerprint-bound.
- **Write mode (per import, default Merge):** *Merge* writes only the fields
  that carry a value in the bundle — blank/omitted fields keep the record's
  existing value, so a partial or skeleton bundle patches rather than wipes.
  *Overwrite* makes the bundle fully define each record (blank fields clear the
  value). Creates always use the bundle's values in either mode. The **dry-run
  is mode-aware**: it shows the exact fields that will change for the selected
  mode (and marks no-change rows "unchanged"); switching mode re-previews.
- **Hand-editing:** bundles are meant to be edited (e.g. tweak a CSV, add a
  lodge folder). The manifest's per-file checksums and row counts are
  **advisory** — a mismatch is surfaced as a dry-run warning, never a hard
  rejection, and the import reads the files actually present (files-first).
  "Reseal edited bundle" regenerates the manifest so an edited bundle validates
  clean again. Only structural/safety problems (not a zip, missing/invalid
  manifest, an unsupported format version, resource caps — enforced BEFORE inflation —
  or unsafe entry paths) are hard-refused. Re-zip mistakes are forgiven (a
  single wrapper folder is stripped, macOS cruft ignored) and anything
  discarded or uncovered warns loudly: a file outside the wrapper, or files
  present for a category the manifest doesn't include, can't be silently
  believed imported.

## Implemented categories

- **site-content** — CMS pages, keyed site content, club theme; embedded images
  travel in the bundle and their `/api/images/<id>` references are remapped on
  import.
- **club-settings** — the club-wide settings singletons (modules, booking
  defaults, member-fields, bed-allocation, booking-request, IB payments, club
  identity (name/short name/hut-leader label), email message settings, group
  discount, membership nomination/lockout/cancellation, login/security policy,
  public-content visibility, subscription-billing policy, and member-guest
  policy). Applying the bundle refreshes the DB-first club-identity cache so
  imported identity takes effect immediately.

  **Field-level allowlisting is audited in both directions (#2178).** Each
  singleton exports only the columns in its `fields` allowlist; every other
  column is named in a per-model `excluded` set with a one-line reason, and two
  drift tests guard both directions — `fields ⊆ columns` (no allowlist names a
  dropped column) and `columns ⊆ fields ∪ excluded` (no column is silently
  never exported). A newly added column therefore fails the reverse test until
  someone classifies it as should-travel or deliberately-excluded. Deliberately
  excluded: the singleton primary key, the `updatedByMemberId` audit FK, and the
  `createdAt`/`updatedAt` timestamps (all instance-local, `COMMON_EXCLUDED_COLUMNS`);
  the retired `ClubModuleSettings.multiLodge` flag; the phase-7 `lodgeId`
  soft-links; `GroupDiscountSetting.rateMembershipTypeId` (an instance-local FK);
  and the two auth-provider sign-in toggles `ClubModuleSettings.magicLink` /
  `googleLogin` (a per-install auth decision; note the login/profile pages
  render these affordances off the flag alone, so an imported `true` on an
  unconfigured target would surface a broken sign-in path — travelling them
  would first need a credential-presence render gate).
  The same shape of call, for the same reason, excludes the two member-guest
  search toggles `MemberGuestSettings.openMemberSearchEnabled` /
  `openMemberSearchIncludesMinors` (#2306, owner decision D-18): they are a club
  **privacy posture**, not a capability — the first decides whether the club's
  membership name list becomes browsable to anyone who can start a booking, and
  the second whether minors appear in that list. An import must never widen a
  target club's member privacy without the target's own admin choosing it, so a
  fresh import keeps whatever the target already had (off, for a new install).
  The rest of that singleton — `approvalRequired` and `pendingHoldExpiryDays` —
  is ordinary portable policy and travels.
  `MembershipLockoutSettings.useFeeScheduleItemCodes` (#2109) is
  classified should-travel and now exports like the rest of that singleton.

  **Model-level completeness is audited too (#2200).** The field-level guard
  above proves no COLUMN inside a registered singleton is dropped; a second guard
  proves no singleton-shaped MODEL is silently absent. "Singleton-shaped" is the
  `id = "default"` upsert pattern — a model whose `@id` scalar defaults to the
  literal `"default"` — enumerated mechanically from `prisma/schema.prisma` by
  `src/lib/config-transfer/singleton-models.ts`. Every such model must be either
  registered for export or named in `MODEL_LEVEL_EXCLUSIONS` with a one-line
  reason, so a future settings singleton fails the test until someone classifies
  it. Models keyed by `cuid()`/`uuid()` or a business unique — e.g.
  `AgeTierSetting` (`@default(cuid())`, `tier @unique`, one row per age tier) —
  are NOT singletons and are out of scope for this guard by shape. Such a portable
  multi-row table travels through the natural-key entity mechanism instead:
  `AgeTierSetting` is exported as the **`age-tier`** entity (see the
  membership-fees category below), keyed on `tier`, so this audit still folds it
  into config transfer rather than leaving it out.

  The audit classified the six models that were absent, plus two the enumeration
  surfaced (`SetupProgress`, `AiAssistantSettings`), as:

  - **Portable club policy — now exported** (`LoginSecuritySetting`,
    `PublicContentSettings`, `MembershipSubscriptionBillingSettings`).
    - `LoginSecuritySetting` — the password-complexity policy and the magic-link
      token TTL. No secret/credential travels: the field-allowlist sweep passes
      (the password-length bound is a portable integer rule, not a secret — the
      `/password.../` forbidden pattern carves out `minPasswordLength` while still
      blocking `passwordHash` and every other credential field). Note that login
      policy travels **by ratified intent** (#2200): importing a source club whose
      password rules are *weaker* than the target's will weaken the target — this
      is surfaced in the dry-run diff for the admin to review before applying, and
      is the expected behaviour of transferring policy, not a leak.
    - `PublicContentSettings` — the six double-opt-in embed visibility gates and
      whether the public "Book Now" button is shown. The button DESTINATION does
      **not** travel: `bookNowTarget` / `bookNowPageId` reference a specific
      install's `PageContent` id (instance-local, excluded like the phase-7
      `lodgeId` and `GroupDiscountSetting.rateMembershipTypeId` FKs), and
      `getBookNowVariants` fails open to the booking flow when the page is absent,
      so a target keeps its own destination and the button is never dead.
    - `MembershipSubscriptionBillingSettings` — the invoice due-days window and
      the club family-billing model. Neither embeds a Xero/provider or tenant
      reference, so both are portable club policy. `familyBillingMode` interacts
      with `PER_FAMILY` fee schedules, which travel in the **membership-fees**
      category; a whole-bundle export stays internally consistent and the
      admin-reviewed dry-run surfaces any partial-import mismatch.
  - **Instance-local — excluded with a reason** (`MODEL_LEVEL_EXCLUSIONS`):
    - `XeroGroupingSettings` — Xero member-grouping mode is bound to the source
      install's connected Xero organisation (tenant); Xero settings never travel.
    - `LodgeSettings` — per-lodge physical/operational settings (bed capacity,
      school-group soft cap) keyed to a specific lodge via `lodgeId`; lodge
      identity and capacity travel through the **lodge-config** category's Lodge
      rows, not this singleton.
    - `SetupProgress` — deployment-local setup-wizard progress (which steps THIS
      install completed/skipped); operational install state, not club policy.
    - `AiAssistantSettings` — the deployment-specific AI monthly spend cap; an
      operational spend control a source club must never reset on a target
      (a fresh import keeps the target's own cap, #2211).
    - `ClubTimeSettings` — the installation's one club time zone (#2989). It does
      not travel for the same reason changing it in-app is Full-Admin-only,
      confirmation-gated and audited: a bundle apply is none of those things, so
      importing it would move every displayed time and every club-local scheduled
      job on the target club with no acknowledgement and no before/after audit
      row naming who did it. A fresh import keeps the target's own zone, and a
      target that has none keeps resolving the zone it is already effectively
      using. **This matters for disaster recovery and clones:** a restored clone
      takes its time zone from the NEW container's environment, not from the
      source club's bundle, so confirm the Club Time Zone step on its setup
      checklist before opening it to members.

  Both `ClubTheme` and the twelve original singletons remain accounted for
  (registered); `ClubTheme` is registered in the site-content category and listed
  in `SINGLETON_MODELS_REGISTERED_ELSEWHERE`.

  **Those three additions did not require a version bump.** At the time,
  `CONFIG_TRANSFER_FORMAT_VERSION` stayed `2`. Adding a model was purely
  additive and tolerated in both directions:
  a post-#2200 bundle imported by a pre-#2200 app (both v2) carries three extra
  `club-settings/*.json` files the older importer simply never reads (it iterates
  its own `SINGLETONS` list), and a pre-#2200 bundle imported by a post-#2200 app
  omits those files, so the files-first importer leaves each new singleton
  untouched. This is unlike the v1→v2 bump (#2187), which was forced by an
  INCOMPATIBLE column collapse on `ClubTheme` that would have silently discarded
  data; adding models loses nothing in either direction, so a bump would only
  gratuitously reject otherwise-importable v2 bundles.

  **Minimum-stay replace semantics require format version 3 (#2363).** A v2
  reader does not understand the destructive `booking-policies` category, and a
  v3 reader must not silently treat an older bundle as a complete policy set.
  Compatibility is therefore exact: `readBundle` rejects any
  `formatVersion != CONFIG_TRANSFER_FORMAT_VERSION`. Re-export with the current
  app before importing; resealing changes checksums, not the bundle's semantic
  version.

  **A singleton the source club never saved is still exported (#2171).** Every
  entry in `SINGLETONS` always produces its JSON file; where the `id = "default"`
  row is absent the exporter emits the **effective defaults** — the values the
  app's own read path synthesises on a miss — so the bundle carries what the
  source club actually runs on and an import reproduces it instead of leaving
  the target's existing row alone. Each spec declares those defaults by
  importing the same constant its getter reads
  (`src/config/club-settings-defaults.ts`, plus the long-standing
  `DEFAULT_MODULE_SETTINGS` and `DEFAULT_MEMBER_FIELDS_SETTINGS`); a second
  hand-written copy in the exporter is the failure mode that shape exists to
  prevent, and a test fails if a spec leaves a field without a declared default.

  Be precise about what this does and does not buy:

  - `club-identity-settings` and `email-message-setting` deliberately export
    **all-null** rather than a value. Every column on those two is a nullable
    override resolved through the install's own `config/club.json`/environment
    fallback chain, so "never saved" means "no override" (exactly what their
    admin GETs synthesise) and the fallback identity belongs to the install, not
    to the club's portable configuration. Exporting it would rename the target
    club and repoint its public URL. `DEFAULTS_INTENTIONALLY_PARTIAL` names the
    two and the coverage test allows only them. This is narrowly about the
    NEVER-SAVED case only: whenever the source's row DOES exist its identity
    fields are ordinary allowlisted fields and **travel normally** — which is
    the intended behaviour, and why applying a bundle refreshes the DB-first
    club-identity cache. On any booted install the row usually does exist:
    `clubIdentitySelfHealStep` (`src/lib/config-self-heal-steps.ts`) creates it at
    boot from `config/club.json`.
  - **An all-null file never creates a row.** `carriesNoValue` in
    `club-settings.ts` skips the create branch (and the plan reports
    `unchanged`) when every allowlisted value in the file is null, in BOTH
    modes. Only the two singletons above can produce such a file. This is not a
    tidiness rule: `clubIdentitySelfHealStep.isPresent` keys purely on the
    `ClubIdentitySettings` ROW existing, and the self-heal runner is skipped
    entirely while `clubConfigSource !== "primary"` on the documented promise
    that it repairs itself on a later boot. An import onto a SAFE_DEFAULT
    install would otherwise plant an all-null row that satisfies that presence
    check forever, so identity would never be healed once `config/club.json`
    was fixed.
  - **Merge mode still ignores blank bundle values** (`updateDataForMode` /
    `rawHasValue`), so those all-null identity entries only clear an EXISTING
    target row's overrides in **overwrite** mode. Booleans and zeroes are
    non-blank and do travel in both modes.
  - **Row existence is no longer preserved.** Importing now MATERIALISES a
    singleton the source never saved, and **four** setup-readiness signals key
    on the row existing rather than on its values. Three are booleans in the
    snapshot (`src/lib/setup-readiness-db.ts`): `bookingDefaultsConfigured`,
    `groupDiscountConfigured`, `membershipCancellationSettingsConfigured`. The
    fourth is in the consumer: the **Module Controls** step reads
    `Boolean(db.adminModuleSettings)` directly (`src/lib/setup-readiness.ts`),
    so an import flips it from *warning* to "Admin Modules activation was
    checked." That step is `required: false`, so it downgrades a warning rather
    than gating readiness. A target club's checklist can therefore report
    booking policies, membership cancellation and module activation as
    configured when nobody configured them. The effective settings are
    unchanged; only the "has an admin been here?" signal is. This is the cost
    the owner accepted on #2171 — bundles get larger and carry rows that were
    never explicitly configured.
  - **One admin-screen affordance disappears with it.** The group-discount card
    treats an unsaved singleton as dirty (`group-discount-section.tsx`, #2142)
    so an admin can create the row while happy with every default. Once an
    import has materialised `GroupDiscountSetting` the GET returns
    `configured: true`, so a pristine card's **Save** is disabled where it used
    to be enabled. Benign — the affordance existed only to create the row, which
    now exists — but it is a visible behaviour change, not purely a checklist one.
  - **A materialised row stops tracking the code default.** Once written, a
    later release that changes the built-in default does not reach that club.
  - **No format-version bump.** #2171 needed no bump (it was `formatVersion 1`
    at the time; #2187 has since taken the format to `2`): the file shape was
    unchanged and only completeness improved. The importer is files-first, so an
    older bundle that omits a singleton still imports and leaves that singleton
    untouched — covered by a test. The same reasoning carried the #2200 model
    additions (see "Model-level completeness" above).
  - **Legacy bed-allocation singleton compatibility (#2593).**
    `club-settings/bed-allocation-settings.json` remains registered for bundles
    and installs that still carry the legacy `id = "default"` row. Its portable
    fields are the auto-allocation switch and ordered priorities; the soft-linked
    source `lodgeId` is excluded. An older singleton file that omits only
    `allocationPriorityOrder` normalises to the historical canonical order,
    while unknown/duplicate values fail preview. Authoritative per-lodge values
    additionally travel in each lodge-config folder as described below; runtime
    resolution decides whether a compatible legacy row or a lodge row applies.
- **booking-policies** - the complete club-wide and lodge-scoped minimum-stay
  policy set in `booking-policies/minimum-stay.csv`. This is the one deliberate
  replace-set category: a policy omitted from the file is previewed as
  **Deleted** and removed on Apply. The file must have this exact ordered header:
  `scope,name,startDate,endDate,triggerDays,minimumNights,capacityMode,active`.
  `scope` is either `club-wide` or `lodge:<slug>`; the prefix keeps a real lodge
  whose slug is `club-wide` distinct from the club-wide scope. Names are
  preserved exactly, including legal leading/trailing spaces and quotes, but
  must contain a non-whitespace character and be at most 200 characters. A
  header-only file is the explicit way to clear the set. An empty, malformed,
  missing-column, extra-column, or reordered-header file blocks Apply and can
  never be interpreted as a clear.

  The category carries a SECOND required file, `booking-policies/adult-member-hosting.csv`
  (#2364), under the same replace-set rules and the same exact-header
  discipline. Its ordered header is `scope,mode,capacityMode`; `scope` uses the
  same `club-wide` / `lodge:<slug>` vocabulary, `mode` is `INHERIT`, `DISABLED`
  or `ADMIN_REVIEW_REQUIRED`, and `INHERIT` is refused for `club-wide`, which has
  nothing to inherit from. A scope omitted from the file is previewed as
  **Deleted** and removed on Apply, returning it to its built-in default — the
  club to "allowed", a lodge to inheriting. Deleting a scope's row is NOT the
  same as storing `DISABLED`: both behave identically, but only the second
  survives as a decision an admin can see they made. Both files are planned
  before either can classify a deletion, so one malformed file cannot let the
  other read as an intentional clear. Adding this file is why bundles are format
  version 4; a version 3 reader would ignore it while reporting that it had
  replaced the club's complete booking-policy set.
- **lodge-config** — lodges, rooms, beds, seasons, season rates, lodge
  instructions (content images bundled + remapped), chore templates, and each
  lodge's bed-allocation settings. Each
  lodge is a **self-contained folder**, `lodge-config/lodges/<slug>/` with a
  `lodge.json` descriptor (slug, name, active, travel note, `isDefault`, door
  code if opted in) plus `rooms.csv` / `beds.csv` / `seasons.csv` /
  `season-rates.csv` / `instructions.csv` / `chore-templates.csv` /
  `bed-allocation-settings.json`. The lodge a row belongs to is
  **implied by its folder**, not a CSV column, so a whole lodge is easy to add,
  curate, or spot as a unit. The full per-lodge file set is always emitted
  (header-only when a collection is empty) so a folder captures the entire
  lodge config and the format is discoverable for hand-authoring.
  `bed-allocation-settings.json` contains `autoAllocationEnabled` and the
  ordered `allocationPriorityOrder`. Export resolves the same effective
  per-lodge value the board and lifecycle use, so a lodge with only a compatible
  legacy/default row still emits its actual behavior. Import matches by the
  sibling `lodge.json` slug and writes the target lodge id, never a source id.
  Unknown, duplicate, or non-array priority values block preview and Apply.
  Explicit `[]` is a real value in both Merge and Overwrite modes and preserves
  neutral ordering. If an older file omits only `allocationPriorityOrder`, the
  importer restores the historical canonical order; omission of
  `autoAllocationEnabled` leaves an existing target unchanged in both modes and
  uses the default only when creating a target row. A bundle with no per-lodge
  settings file at all leaves that lodge row untouched; an older legacy
  singleton file may still restore the compatible fallback described above.
  This optional additive file remains part of config-transfer format version 4;
  it does not require a format-version bump.
  `seasons.csv` carries the season windows plus the per-season **flat
  whole-lodge night rate** (#2338):
  `name, type, startDate, endDate, active, flatWholeLodgeNightCents` — the last
  column is integer cents, and a blank cell means the season has no flat
  whole-lodge rate (whole-lodge bookings then price per guest). A pre-#2338
  bundle simply omits the column, which imports as "leave unset", so old bundles
  still restore cleanly.
  `season-rates.csv` is keyed by membership type (#1930, E4):
  `seasonName, membershipTypeKey, ageTier, pricePerNightCents` — a blank
  `ageTier` is a flat type's single all-ages rate. Only rate-bearing types are
  emitted (every `MEMBER_RATE` type plus `NON_MEMBER`). The old-bundle import
  compat for the legacy `seasonName, ageTier, isMember, pricePerNightCents`
  shape **closed one release after the E13 contraction (#2131)**: such a bundle
  is now **rejected** on import with a clear validation error (re-export it from
  an install running the current release, or hand-fix it with the
  [conversion recipe](../guides/config-transfer.md#converting-a-legacy-bundle-by-hand)).
  **v0.12.2 was the last release that could import the
  legacy `isMember` shape.** Instructions
  are two-level: the top-level `lodge-config/instructions.csv` holds the
  **club-wide base** shown for every lodge, while a lodge folder's
  `instructions.csv` holds that lodge's **overrides** of the same keys.
- **committee** — the `CommitteeRole` definitions only (the new, live
  role/assignment model's config). The legacy standalone committee directory
  (`CommitteeMember`) is **not** transferred — it is a migration aid, not
  ongoing config — and member-linked `CommitteeAssignment`s stay out because
  they reference real members.
- **induction** — induction checklist templates with their nested sections and
  items (as JSON documents; member-specific results excluded).
- **membership-fees** — the membership **fee schedules** (#1941): joining fees
  (`JoiningFee`, #1931/E5) and annual membership fees with their invoice-line
  components (`MembershipAnnualFee` + `MembershipAnnualFeeComponent`, #1932/E6).
  Three CSVs, each keyed by an explicit natural key (never a database id) and
  exported in a deterministic, install-independent order so
  export→import→export is byte-stable; money stays in integer cents throughout:
  - `membership-fees/joining-fees.csv` —
    `membershipTypeKey, ageTier, effectiveFrom, effectiveTo, amountCents`;
    natural key `membershipTypeKey × ageTier × effectiveFrom` (a blank `ageTier`
    is a flat-fee type's single NULL-tier window, e.g. the built-in Family type).
  - `membership-fees/annual-fees.csv` —
    `membershipTypeKey, ageTier, effectiveFrom, effectiveTo, amountCents,
    billingBasis, prorationRule`; natural key
    `membershipTypeKey × ageTier × effectiveFrom` (#2067; a blank `ageTier` is
    the flat, whole-type fee, and a blank `prorationRule` defaults to `NONE`). A
    `PER_FAMILY` fee must be flat — a per-family row with a non-blank `ageTier`
    is a blocking row error. A pre-#2067 bundle without the column imports every
    row as flat.
  - `membership-fees/annual-fee-components.csv` —
    `membershipTypeKey, ageTier, effectiveFrom, label, amountCents, prorate,
    xeroAccountCode, xeroItemCode, sortOrder`; natural key
    `(parent fee = membershipTypeKey × ageTier × effectiveFrom) × label`. Each
    row is one Xero invoice line.
  - `membership-fees/age-tiers.csv` (#2200) — the club's per-tier
    age-classification **policy** (`AgeTierSetting`):
    `tier, minAge, maxAge, label, subscriptionRequiredForBooking,
    familyGroupRequestCreateMemberAllowed, sortOrder`; natural key `tier`
    (`AgeTier @unique`). These seven columns are exactly what `getAgeTierSettings`
    reads — portable policy. **Excluded:** the per-install `id` cuid (no FK
    references it — every consumer keys off the `AgeTier` **enum** value, not this
    row id) and the `createdAt`/`updatedAt` audit timestamps. `NOT_APPLICABLE` (the
    server-managed organisation/school tier that never has a row) is a blocking
    row error, as is a duplicate `tier`. Apply **rekeys by `tier`**: an imported
    row updates the target's existing row for that tier **in place** (by the
    target's own id, never the source id) or creates a new row for a tier the
    target lacks — `tier @unique` makes duplication impossible and nothing is
    orphaned. Because apply is upsert-only (never deletes), the planner validates
    the **effective post-merge** tier set against the same partition rule the admin
    API enforces (`validateAgeTierPartition`: a complete, non-overlapping
    `[0, ∞)` partition with `ADULT` as the unbounded terminal tier); a subset
    bundle that would leave the target with an overlapping/gapped partition is
    blocked with an actionable error rather than silently misclassifying member
    ages. `age-tiers.csv` rides the membership-fees category as its own module and
    is emitted whenever the source has age tiers (independent of whether it has
    fees), so it does not affect the joining-fee precedence rule below.

  Referenced membership types must already exist on the target (matched by
  `key`) — membership types themselves are not transferred (they are managed on
  the Membership Types page); an unknown key is a blocking row error, exactly
  like the season-rates and item-code categories. The **#1932 component
  invariant** is enforced at plan time against the bundle's own amounts: a
  `NO_INVOICE` fee is a zero total with **no** components; every invoiceable fee
  carries ≥1 component whose amounts sum **exactly** to the fee total. An
  annual-fee row must therefore always travel with its full component set (as
  the export always emits), and components whose parent fee is absent from the
  bundle are a clean error. Apply is **upsert-only** (like every ordinary
  category):
  joining fees and annual fees upsert by their natural key; components upsert by
  `(parent fee, label)`. A component the bundle drops on an existing install is
  **not** deleted (this category never deletes) — remove a component from a
  fee on the Fees page, not by re-import.

  **Precedence over the #1931 item-code path:** when a bundle carries
  `membership-fees/joining-fees.csv`, its joining-fee schedule is authoritative,
  so the **xero-config item-code-amount joining-fee materialisation is
  suppressed** (it would otherwise invent/duplicate `JoiningFee` windows from
  the item-code `amountCents` column). A bundle without `joining-fees.csv`, or
  one imported with membership-fees deselected, keeps the item-code fan-out so
  its joining fees are not silently dropped.
- **xero-config** — Xero account mappings and item-code mappings. HUT_FEE item
  codes are keyed by membership type (#1930, E4): `item-code-mappings.csv` is
  `category, membershipTypeKey, ageTier, seasonType, entranceFeeCategory,
  itemCode, amountCents` (membershipTypeKey is HUT_FEE-only; blank for
  JOINING_FEE). Frozen legacy `isMember`-keyed HUT_FEE rows are not exported.
  The old-bundle import compat **closed one release after the E13 contraction
  (#2131)**: a bundle carrying the legacy `isMember` HUT_FEE column, or the
  pre-#1931 `ENTRANCE_FEE` category name, is now **rejected** on import with a
  clear validation error rather than silently mapped/normalised — **v0.12.2 was
  the last release that could import that shape** (re-export from an install
  running the current release, or hand-fix it with the
  [conversion recipe](../guides/config-transfer.md#converting-a-legacy-bundle-by-hand)).
  Relatedly, a `HUT_FEE` row with a **blank `membershipTypeKey`** is now a
  blocking row error too: the export always emits the key, and writing a keyless
  row would create a frozen-legacy-shaped mapping the runtime never reads (and
  which would re-create on every import). Because the runtime no longer reads item-code-mapping `amountCents`
  for joining fees, any imported `JOINING_FEE` amount whose category has **no
  covering `JoiningFee` window** on the target is **materialised into open
  JoiningFee windows** using the migration's D-R1 fan-out (per-tier to every
  liable membership type; FAMILY as the Family type's flat fee), bounded to the
  day before any future window. Categories with a covering window are left
  alone. A bundle carrying the first-class **membership-fees** category's
  `joining-fees.csv` (#1941) supersedes this fan-out — the schedule there is
  authoritative, so the item-code fan-out is skipped to avoid duplicating/skewing
  it. The source Xero org id is recorded in a
  category-local `xero-config/source.json` (sealed with the rest of the category,
  not the manifest); the plan warns on an org mismatch so codes are verified
  before applying.

Intentionally excluded / deferred:

- **Integration / provider credentials (`IntegrationCredential`) — never, in any
  form.** The encrypted Xero/Stripe/Google/backup secrets a club has connected
  are **permanently excluded from config transfer**: neither the encrypted values
  (`ciphertext`/`iv`/`authTag`) nor any per-field metadata about them ever enters
  or leaves a bundle. This is enforced two ways at once. **(1) Entity exclusion:**
  the `IntegrationCredential` entity is simply never registered for export — no
  category module declares a descriptor for it — so nothing on the row, including
  the un-patternable `iv` column, can ride along. This is asserted by the
  "registers NO IntegrationCredential entity" test in
  `src/lib/__tests__/config-transfer-registry.test.ts`, which walks every
  registered descriptor and fails if one names the entity, its file, or any of
  the `iv`/`ciphertext`/`authTag` fields. **(2) Field-name sweep (defence in
  depth):** the `ciphertext` and `auth.?tag` patterns sit in
  `FORBIDDEN_FIELD_PATTERNS` in `src/lib/config-transfer/registry.ts`, and
  `assertDescriptorValid` (run at module load and in tests) throws if any future
  descriptor's allowlist ever names such a field. So even a mistaken attempt to
  register the entity would fail the build.

  **Presence-metadata export was considered and rejected.** The alternative
  floated on the review was to travel non-secret "which providers are configured"
  booleans (never any value or ciphertext) so an imported clone could surface
  honest "re-enter credentials" affordances instead of showing nothing. The owner
  decided against it (decision on #2205, 2026-07-23): the wholesale exclusion is
  ratified as **permanent policy**, credential rows never travel field-level or
  otherwise, and no presence metadata is exported. A restored clone is *expected*
  to come up with no connected providers and re-enter them — the correct, safe
  outcome (see [Credentials at rest](../SECURITY-ATTACK-SURFACE.md#credentials-at-rest-2079)
  in the attack-surface doc).
- Per-lodge capacity / `LodgeSettings` — the `id="default"`-vs-`lodgeId` storage
  duality is unsafe to round-trip; set it on the lodge page (ADR-001).
- Cancellation and booking-period policies remain deferred. Minimum-stay
  policies now travel through the dedicated `booking-policies` category above;
  cancellation policy still touches refund maths and booking periods have not
  adopted its reviewed replace-set contract.
- Xero contact-group rules / accepted groups — FK to member types / age-tier
  settings and are Xero-org-specific.

## What it is / is not

- **Is:** a portable, human-editable, database-id-free interchange for
  *configuration, content, and lodge setup* — pages, settings, lodges, rooms,
  beds, seasons, rates, policies, instructions, chore templates, committee
  roles, induction templates, membership fee schedules (joining fees, annual
  fees and their invoice-line components), Xero configuration mappings.
- **Is not:** a database backup. The `pg_dump` subsystem (`src/lib/backup.ts`)
  remains the whole-database disaster-recovery tool. Ordinary categories do not
  delete, but the minimum-stay booking-policy category deliberately replaces
  its complete set after previewing every deletion. The automatic pre-apply DB
  backup is the true rollback.
- **Never contains:** secrets, members, auth/role fields, transactional data
  (bookings, payments, credits, allocations), Xero connection/runtime state,
  **integration / provider credentials** (`IntegrationCredential`, permanently
  excluded — see the intentionally-excluded list at the end of
  [Implemented categories](#implemented-categories) above), or (by default) lodge
  door codes.

## Implementation notes

- The import plan is **stateless**: computed for the dry-run, returned to the
  client, and re-derived at apply time. A **fingerprint** of the touched rows is
  taken at plan time and re-checked at apply; if the database changed in between,
  the apply is refused and the admin re-runs the dry-run (ADR-002). No schema
  migration is required.
- Lock order is `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('config-transfer-import'))`
  first, then the shared minimum-stay policy-set lock, then the adult-member
  hosting policy-set lock, when the booking-policy category is selected.
  Planning is repeated after every lock is held (see
  `docs/CONCURRENCY_AND_LOCKING.md`).

## Cleaned-literal re-plant guard (#2511)

A bundle exported **before** a value-scoped "cleanup" migration still carries the
old value: the exporter selects the DB column verbatim, and the applier writes it
straight back — in **Merge** mode as well as **Overwrite**, because Merge only
skips fields the bundle leaves blank. Because the boot auto-import runs *after*
migrations (see the order in the next section), a disaster-recovery rebuild or an
interactive restore of a pre-cleanup bundle would re-plant the removed value
**permanently** — the one-shot migration has already run and never corrects the
row again.

`src/lib/config-transfer/cleaned-literals.ts` is the single source of truth for
the removed byte-strings and the migration that removed each. On import (boot and
interactive alike) the site-content planner/applier consult it:

- when a bundle field **byte-matches** a cleaned literal for that entity/key, the
  applier **skips writing that one field**, leaving the cleaned state the
  migration established, and the dry-run surfaces a **named warning row**
  ("this bundle would restore … that a cleanup migration removed");
- every **other** field in the same bundle imports normally, and a club's **own**
  customised value never byte-matches, so it is imported untouched — value-scoped,
  exactly like the migrations themselves;
- the boot auto-import is unattended, so "skip" is fail-safe **by construction**:
  it cannot re-plant and needs no operator decision. It has no dry-run preview, so
  it instead writes the same warnings to the **boot log** at `WARN`
  (`bootstrap-import.ts`), naming each skipped literal — the DR operator learns a
  stale bundle was cleaned rather than silently re-planted.

The registry currently covers the front-page hero (#2431) and the footer
affiliations (#2490), which the bundle round-trips, plus the lodge address
(#2484) as a **dormant** entry — `Lodge.address` is not part of the bundle today
(absent from `LODGE_FIELDS`), so nothing can carry it. The lodge planner/applier
**already route their write through the guard** (`categories/lodge-config.ts`),
so the entry is **live-by-construction** — a guaranteed no-op until `address`
becomes portable, and an active strip the instant it does. Adding `address` to
`LODGE_FIELDS` does not silently reopen the exposure: the contract test in
`config-transfer-cleaned-literals.test.ts` keys on the entry's `dormant` flag and
**fails the build** the moment the field becomes exportable, forcing a deliberate
transition (drop `dormant`, add a behavioural strip test).

The literals are asserted byte-for-byte against the migrations by
`config-transfer-cleaned-literals.test.ts`, so registry and migration cannot
drift apart. That same test also enforces the **reverse** link as far as is
mechanically sound: any migration whose `UPDATE … WHERE` clause **pins the byte
value** of an exportable content column (`headerText`, `contentHtml`, `address`)
must either register a `CLEANED_LITERALS` entry or sit on a small, self-checked
exempt list — so a future value-scoped cleanup of exportable content cannot land
un-registered without turning CI red.

**Authoring rule (for migration authors).** When you write a value-scoped cleanup
migration that clears or replaces an **exportable** content value a config bundle
round-trips — any `PageContent`/`SiteContent` value, or a `Lodge` field once it is
in `LODGE_FIELDS` — add a matching entry to
`src/lib/config-transfer/cleaned-literals.ts` so restoring a pre-cleanup bundle
cannot put the old value back. A rewrite matched only by `slug`/`key` (not by the
old value) round-trips nothing removable and needs no entry. Operators should
still **re-export bundles after upgrading** — see `docs/UPGRADING.md`.

## Boot-time bootstrap auto-import (DR / clone, ADR-003, #1988)

For disaster recovery or seeding a replacement instance, a bundle can be applied
**non-interactively at boot** instead of through the admin UI. Set
`CONFIG_BUNDLE_IMPORT_PATH` to a readable bundle file: on the next Node boot —
after migrations, base seed, and the C2 self-heal — the app applies that bundle
**iff the database is empty of non-seed configuration**, through this same
validated pipeline (`src/lib/config-transfer/bootstrap-import.ts`).

- **Empty-target only, fail closed.** "Empty of non-seed configuration" means
  the pristine post-seed state with **no operator footprint** — six signals,
  ALL of which must be absent: no prior config import (interactive or
  bootstrap), no bookings, no non-system members, the setup wizard never
  finished, the setup wizard never even driven (no completed/skipped steps),
  and no audit-log row with a member actor (which catches direct-admin-editor
  configuration). Any of those present → the import is **refused** and nothing
  is written. A malformed/tampered/oversized bundle, an unreadable path, a
  probe error, or any apply failure also refuses; boot always continues. This
  includes a **legacy bundle** (#2131): it fails plan-time validation, so the
  bootstrap refuses (`refused-invalid`), writes nothing, and the replacement
  install comes up **unconfigured** — the only signal is the boot log line
  naming the first validation error, so keep the bundle at
  `CONFIG_BUNDLE_IMPORT_PATH` in the current export shape. (A
  plain "the plan has no updates" check is deliberately NOT used — the base
  seed pre-creates the config rows the bundle touches, so a legitimate
  bootstrap always shows updates; see ADR-003 "Empty-target definition".)
- **Race-safe.** The emptiness probe is re-run INSIDE the apply advisory lock
  before anything is written, and the idempotence marker commits in the same
  transaction as the config writes — so concurrent replica boots apply exactly
  once (the losers log a calm INFO refusal; see `DEPLOYMENT.md` "Expected
  logs").
- **Rename abort (reachable).** The seed creates key-weak defaults (induction
  template, example chore templates); a bundle whose source renamed them
  produces rename candidates that need a human, so the bootstrap aborts
  (`refused-invalid`, nothing written) and enumerates the entities in the log.
  Fallback: import the bundle interactively via Admin → Setup & Configuration →
  Export & Import and resolve the renames there.
- **Not gated on config provenance.** The bundle is the config source in a DR
  restore where `config/club.json` may be absent, so — unlike the self-heal —
  this import runs regardless of `clubConfigSource`.
- **Pre-apply backup waived (only here, type-enforced).** An empty database has
  nothing to protect; the waiver requires a branded proof object only the
  positive empty-target probe can mint, so no other caller compiles. Every
  other ADR-002 safeguard (validation, allowlist, DMMF type-checks,
  single-flight lock, fingerprint drift refusal, atomic transaction, audit)
  still applies. On a fresh target both booking-policy replace-sets have nothing
  to delete; malformed or ambiguous policy input still refuses the whole import.
- **Audited + idempotent.** A success writes a `configuration.bootstrap_imported`
  audit row in the apply transaction (system/deploy actor, bundle sha256,
  outcome; shown as "System" in the admin audit log); a second boot with the
  same variable set sees that marker and refuses calmly without touching the
  bundle file.

Operator runbook and expected logs: `DEPLOYMENT.md` → "Config Bundle Auto-Import
On Boot (DR / clone)".
