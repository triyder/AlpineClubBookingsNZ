/**
 * Shared state for the canonical admin settings-section pattern (#2136).
 *
 * `AGENTS.md` makes the pattern binding for new or modified admin settings
 * sections: the section loads read-only, a per-section Edit reveals
 * Save/Cancel, no individual control auto-persists, Cancel reverts to the saved
 * snapshot, and Save persists once. Every card that implements it by hand ends
 * up re-deriving the same draft/snapshot pair, and the two details that are
 * easiest to get subtly wrong are exactly the ones this hook centralises:
 *
 *  1. Cancel must restore EVERY field from the snapshot. Hand-rolled cards do
 *     this field-by-field, so a field added later is easy to forget.
 *  2. Save must re-seed BOTH the draft and the snapshot from the AUTHORITATIVE
 *     value the server returned — never from the local draft. A server that
 *     clamps, normalises, or otherwise adjusts the submitted value would
 *     otherwise leave the card showing something the server never stored.
 *
 * What this hook deliberately does NOT own: the feedback presentation and its
 * clearing rules. Booking-policy sections render `<PolicyFeedback>` while the
 * security cards render `<Alert>`, and each card clears its messages at
 * slightly different moments (some on Edit, some on Cancel, some on neither).
 * Folding those differences in would have meant a boolean option per card, so
 * the hook only owns the one clearing rule every card already shares — both
 * messages are cleared at the start of a save — and exposes `setError` /
 * `setSuccess` so each card keeps its existing behaviour explicitly.
 *
 * The transport also stays in the caller's `save` callback, so idioms that are
 * genuinely per-card survive untouched: the security cards' GET-fresh-settings-
 * then-merge step (never clobber a module another card changed since page
 * load), multi-endpoint saves, and per-endpoint failure messages.
 *
 * Reference adopter: `src/components/admin/booking-policies/group-discount-section.tsx`.
 */

/**
 * Throw this from a `save` callback when the write was rejected with 403. The
 * hook maps it to the shared {@link ADMIN_FORBIDDEN_SAVE_REASON} copy, which is
 * the defence-in-depth case behind the UI gating (#1927): a stale tab still
 * showing live editors because the actor's permissions were narrowed after the
 * page loaded.
