 *    return to and, once the editor has rendered, REVEALS it (#4115): focus
 *    goes to the first control the opening made editable, or to the section
 *    (`revealOpenedEditor`). `revealTarget` replaces that with a
 *    `revealEditor` of the given element; it exists for the two sections
 *    whose card reveal predates #4115, and a new section omits it. Neither
 *    moves focus the admin has moved elsewhere, nor into a section hidden
 *    behind a modal (`mayRevealOpenedEditor`);
 *  - `close()` from every user action that closes it (Cancel, a successful
 *    save, a save conflict that closes the stale editor) — never from a scope
 *    change or a background refresh, which are not the admin leaving it;
 *  - `triggerProps(key)` on an opening control that is NOT mounted while the
 *    editor is open (Edit, Add), so its replacement can be found; a control
 *    that stays mounted (a per-row Edit) is returned to directly;
 *  - `regionProps` on the section's card, the fallback when the trigger is
 *    gone or disabled. It makes the card a `region` named by `titleProps`,
 *    which goes on the card's visible title, so a keyboard user who lands on
 *    the card hears its name rather than "group" (#2934) — or, for a card with
 *    no visible title of its own, by `regionLabel`.

 * `useRowActionFocusReturn` instead, by these same markers; why its anchor
