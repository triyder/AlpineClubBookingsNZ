      //
      // DELETE THE ROW, do not null the one field. Two reasons, and the first
      // is a correctness bug rather than a tidiness preference:
      //
      //  1. `XeroContactCache` is an OBSERVATION of Xero, and every reader
      //     treats it as one. `buildXeroContactCompanyNumberPatch` reads a row
      //     that exists and holds `null` as "we looked, and Xero's NZBN field
      //     is empty" — which is its permission to write. Nulling here would
      //     MANUFACTURE that permission about a field that, per #2873, still
      //     holds the value in Xero, and nothing re-observes it: the contact
      //     was not modified so an `ifModifiedSince` sync skips it, no member
      //     links to it any more, and the group repair only fills in MISSING
      //     rows. A later namesake or re-registration matched onto that same
      //     contact would then have a real business number overwritten by a
      //     birthday — the exact defect the guard exists to prevent, re-created
      //     by the privacy fix. Deleting restores the honest "nothing is known"
      //     state, which the guard refuses to write into.
      //  2. The row also holds the member's cached name, email, phone and
      //     address. Clearing one field would leave all of those in place,
      //     which contradicts the privacy argument above.
      //
      // Removing the value from XERO is a separate question — it conflicts with
      // the standing rule that this app never blanks that field, because it
      // cannot tell a birthday it wrote from a business number somebody typed —
      // and is tracked as #2873. Until that is answered the value survives in
      // Xero, so a later full resync that observes this contact can cache it
      // again: this clears what the server holds now, it does not make the
      // provider forget. Precedent for the shape: `xero-mismatch-resync.ts`.
