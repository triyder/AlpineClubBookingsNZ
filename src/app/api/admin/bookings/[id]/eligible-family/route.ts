/**
 * GET /api/admin/bookings/[id]/eligible-family

 * On-behalf family picker for the EDIT-booking flow. Gated on `bookings:edit`
 * (NOT membership:view), so a Booking Officer whose customised role has had
 * membership:view removed can still attach the correct member identity to a
 * guest and get correct member pricing — instead of the picker silently
 * emptying and the member being re-added as a mispriced non-member
 * (issue #1376, owner-approved option A).
 *
 * The booking owner's memberId is read SERVER-SIDE from the booking; the client
 * never supplies a member id here. It returns exactly one member's family group
 * (via the shared resolveMemberFamily helper), never a directory enumeration.
