  // #2269 (F3): the advisory half. Everything above answers "is this override
  // still VALID?"; this answers the question an admin actually asks — "my saved
  // copy is not the built-in wording any more; does that matter?"
  //
  // WHY THIS IS NOT A HASH COMPARISON. The tempting design is to stamp each
  // override with a hash of the default it was authored against and flag any
  // row whose stamp no longer matches. It was rejected twice over. First, a
  // stamp can only describe saves made AFTER it ships: every row that exists
  // today — the entire population this issue exists for — would carry no stamp
  // and the feature would be dark on exactly the clubs it is for, and there is
  // no honest way to backfill it because nobody knows which historical default
  // a given club copied. Second, and worse, it fires on every release that
  // touches a default at all, including a comma in a paragraph the club deleted
  // years ago; its only remedy is Restore Default, which destroys the
  // customisation. That is precisely the false "you have drifted" noise #2269
  // says not to produce.
  //
  // So the WARNING is reserved for things that are objectively wrong with the
  // saved copy, each one already defined by a rule the save path enforces, and
  // the plain fact "your copy differs from the built-in wording" is reported
  // WITHOUT alarm alongside a diff, because differing is what an override is
  // FOR. The reasons are:
  //
  //   missing_required_token — the registry says this email must show the
  //     member something (the promo explanation, the way into the lodge) and
  //     the saved body no longer does. Honours requiredTokenAlternatives
  //     (#2267), so a club that writes its own "Door code: {{doorCode}}" line
  //     instead of {{doorCodeNote}} is NOT nagged. This is the drift #2267
  //     created and nothing surfaced: such a row cannot even be re-saved today.
  //   retired_token / bracket_annotation — the two #2320 already banners. They
  //     are repeated per template so the editor can show one consolidated
  //     indicator on the template you have open, instead of making you read a
  //     list of names at the top of the page and match them up yourself.
  //   dangling_line — a line of the saved copy renders as a bare label when a
  //     token the sender can legitimately supply EMPTY comes back empty. This
  //     is the reason #2269's own migration made urgent: the shipped defaults
  //     padded "[only when discountCents > 0]" onto
  //     "Discount ({{promoCode}}): -{{discount}}", and once the migration
  //     removes the bracket the line still goes out as "Discount (): -" on an
  //     ordinary booking and "Discount (PEAK): -" on a promo that RAISED the
  //     price — a member charged MORE shown a "Discount" line, which is the
  //     #2267 incident word for word. This is objectively wrong output, not a
  //     matter of taste, so it belongs in `reasons` without breaching the rule
  //     that we never nag an admin about wording they chose.
  //   stripped_annotation — this row is one the #2269 migration rewrote, and it
  //     has not been saved since. It is NOT derived by re-detecting a marker —
  //     the marker is what the migration deleted — but from the migration's own
  //     audit row, which records the previous wording verbatim. It exists
  //     because `dangling_line` above can only see a line with a TOKEN in it: a
  //     conditional line of pure prose ("Payment has been processed
  //     successfully. [only when the booking is already paid]") is structurally
  //     invisible to guard 4, and before the migration the bracket itself was
  //     the signal. Without this, stripping that line's annotation would take a
  //     row from "bracket_annotation, with a banner" to nothing at all, and a
  //     member who still owes $240 would read that their payment succeeded.
  //   invalid_content — the catch-all. `reasons` above names five of the
  //     validator's eleven issue codes (stripped_annotation and dangling_line are
  //     this change's own, not the validator's); a row that trips one of the
  //     other six (a sensitive token in a subject is the reachable one, and
  //     #2774's missing_required_subject_token and forbidden_subject_phrase
  //     joined it) cannot be re-saved and would otherwise be told nothing at all.
  // Only a SAVED override can have been rewritten by the migration, so a club
  // that has never customised a message pays nothing for this.
