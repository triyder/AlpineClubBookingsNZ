/**
 * Render-null leaf that re-surfaces, through the global help widget, the four
 * blocks the retired `BookingHelpDialog` carried (#1371 F28, epic #2094 C2):
 *  (a) the booking status glossary (#1072);
 *  (b) the family-members section and its exact profile Family Group deep link;
 *  (c) the cancellation refund schedule when a payment has been captured; and
 *  (d) the plain "no payment received, no refund" guidance for an unpaid but
 *      cancellable booking (owner review of PR #1389).
 *
 * The branch logic for (c)/(d) is ported verbatim: the refund schedule shows
 * ONLY when a payment was captured, so its tier percentages never imply a refund
 * the member cannot receive; otherwise the no-refund message shows instead.
 *
 * It takes the same props the dialog took (`cancellationSchedule`,
 * `cancellationHasNoPayment`) and registers them as widget extras, deregistering
 * on unmount.
