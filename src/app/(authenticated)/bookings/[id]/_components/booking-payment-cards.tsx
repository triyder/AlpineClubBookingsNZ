          The lifecycle check is load-bearing, not tidiness (#2350): cancelling a
          booking marks the additional intent FAILED and leaves the amount alone,
          so an amount-and-status-only condition kept showing the owner of a
          CANCELLED booking a "pay this extra" card — and the secret route behind
          it would still hand out a confirmable client secret.

          #3641: the booking half of the member's pay door, the same predicate
          the secret route's door (`resolveAdditionalPaymentDoor`) is built on,
          so the card, the route and the Xero reaper share one lifecycle rule.
          Not the whole door: that needs an intent, and this card is shown for an
          uncollected amount with none (a failed mint), to say it is owing. */}
