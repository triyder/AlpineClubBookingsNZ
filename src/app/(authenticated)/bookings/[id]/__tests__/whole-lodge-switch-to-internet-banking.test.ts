/*
  Fork, booking-fixes — the switch-to-Internet-Banking door on an approved
  member whole-lodge booking.

  The approval leaves the payment method to the member when the Internet
  Banking and Xero modules are both on: the booking is CONFIRMED and held, owes
  its whole price, and carries NO Payment row. The booking page must therefore
  offer it the ordinary Complete Payment card AND the switch button, which it
  used to withhold from every status but PAYMENT_PENDING. The rule is shared
  with the switch route (`isSwitchableToInternetBanking`), so this suite pins
  the rule once and the page's use of it once.
