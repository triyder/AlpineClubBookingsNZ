  /**
   * MG4 (#2309): the edit panel's "+ Add Member Guest" surface, decided HERE.
   *
   * SERVER-SIDE, ON PURPOSE. The module flag and the policy singleton are
   * settings reads, and `BookingEditorData` is serialised into a client
   * component's payload — so the panel is handed an answer rather than left to
   * guess one and render a finder whose routes then 404.
   *
   * ABSENT WHEN THE MODULE IS OFF, as a conditional SPREAD rather than a
   * false-valued key. React Flight serialises the key as well as the value, so
   * `memberGuest: undefined` would still ship `"memberGuest":"$undefined"` and
   * change every club's payload; omitting the key leaves a non-adopting club's
   * booking page byte-for-byte what it was.
   *
   * TWO READERS, ONE FIELD. `openSearchEnabled` answers "may THIS reader search
   * by name", which is a different question for each: the club's own privacy
   * setting for a member, and `membership:view` for an officer (owner decision
   * D-20 — an admin picker is not bound by a member-facing privacy switch, and
   * the #1376 persona without membership access falls back to exact email).
   *
   * AND "WHICH READER" IS DECIDED BY THE SAME PREDICATE THE PANEL ROUTES ON,
   * which is `viewerAuthorizationRole === "ADMIN"` — i.e. `bookings:edit`. It
   * was previously `isAdmin || canViewAsAdmin` (`bookings:view`), and the two
   * disagree over a real, shipped persona: a read-only bookings viewer. One
   * holding `membership:view` was handed a name type-ahead while the panel sent
   * them down the MEMBER routes, where the name search 404s unless the club
   * turned open search on — a search box that silently fails. One WITHOUT
   * `membership:view` was denied name search on a club that had deliberately
   * turned it on for every member, including them. Deriving both from one
   * predicate is the fix: whoever is not in admin mode is a member for this
   * purpose and gets exactly the club's member-facing answer.
   *
   * THE FAMILY BOUNDARY IS NOT SHIPPED FROM HERE, and that is deliberate rather
   * than an omission. The panel already fetches the booking owner's family list
   * for its quick-add row — `/api/members/family` for a member, the booking's
   * `eligible-family` for an officer — so it holds the same set this page would
   * have had to query for, and reading it from the row it already renders means
   * the panel's idea of "my family" cannot disagree with the buttons above it.
   * That is the create wizard's rule (`predictMemberGuestConsent`), applied to
   * the second surface rather than re-derived for it.
