/**
 * Member-facing whole-lodge request form (#2263).
 *
 * A separate page from the four-step booking wizard, which is untouched. It asks
 * for dates, an approximate headcount, who the group is and any notes — and
 * deliberately shows NO availability calendar, NO capacity pre-check, NO price
 * and NO quote. Each of those would answer "is the lodge free that week?", which
 * is the question a member may not be answered (ADR-001 decision 6).
 *
 * The one figure it does show is the member's OWN account-credit balance, so
 * they can ask for it to be put towards the booking if the request is
 * approved — the same election the ordinary review step offers. It is a fact
 * about the member, not about the calendar.
