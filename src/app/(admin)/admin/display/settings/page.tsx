// the club default lodge (old backlog #64). This path now permanently redirects
// to the Display Devices page (/admin/display/devices, moved off /admin/display
// by fork issue #109 when that path became the Lobby Display hub) so old
// bookmarks / links keep working; a pointer on that page directs admins to the
// new per-lodge home. Devices is the closest surviving Lobby Display surface.
