/**
 * Club Time Zone — the Full-Admin maintenance surface for the club's time zone
 * (CT-1, #2989; epic #2988).
 *
 * THE WHOLE SCREEN IS FULL ADMIN, which is why it is shaped like
 * `/admin/config-transfer` rather than like an ordinary settings section. There
 * is no view tier and no edit tier to distinguish, so there is nothing for
 * `AdminViewOnlySectionBanner` to explain; a support-area admin who reaches the
 * page (the route is registered under `support` so it resolves to a concrete
 * permission area rather than the `overview` catch-all) is told plainly that this
 * one is Full Admin only. The real enforcement is server-side —
 * `requireAdmin({ permission: false })` on both verbs of
 * `/api/admin/club-time-zone` — and this check exists so the screen does not
 * offer an action it knows will be refused.
 *
 * THE BLURB SAYS WHAT IS TRUE TODAY, which is less than it first said (#2989
 * review). CT-1 records the zone; no production code path reads it yet, so the
 * times the site shows and the club-local schedules still come from the
 * deployment's `TZ`. Saying otherwise here would have an operator change this
 * setting expecting displayed times to follow, and then find they had not. The
 * second paragraph goes when the reader of the setting arrives — the change that
 * makes the claim true is the change that gets to make it.

          rosters, reminders, cut-offs — are worked out in this zone, and so are
          the dates on invoices and credit notes sent to Xero. Scheduled jobs are

          started with until it is restarted.
