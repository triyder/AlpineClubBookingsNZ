              <p>
                The club was formed by a group of local people with varied outdoor
                interests and means of employment at a time when the Tongariro
                National Park authorities were making building sites available to
                clubs. The primary objective of the club as stated in its
                constitution is: to encourage tramping, mountaineering, climbing,
                skiing, and alpine activities in New Zealand.
              </p>
              <p>
                The initially very small group decided they would put a lodge on
                Ruapehu and were fortunate enough to have their application accepted
                and were allocated a site. The first stage of the lodge was built
                within two years: raising the money occupied half of that time, site
                preparation and foundation work most of the rest of the available
                time (when the site was not buried in snow). The actual lodge
                building was carried out on one weekend &mdash; the floor was put
                down on Friday 21/3/69, the lodge went up on Saturday, and the roof
                cladding was completed on Sunday. Two more extensions have since
                been added to provide reasonably comfortable lodge accommodation for
                up to twenty-nine people.
              </p>
              <p>
                The largest group of club lodge users are winter sports enthusiasts,
                but there are a significant number of others who make use of the
                facilities throughout the year: photographers, trampers, family
                parties, school groups, naturalists, various social clubs, and some
                who just want to get away for some peace and quiet on the mountain.
                The club has always encouraged family participation in its
                activities and family membership charges are currently at a cheaper
                rate than the equivalent individual memberships.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lodge fees have been kept to a minimum and are probably among the
                lowest on the mountain. This is achieved by the members doing just
                about everything they possibly can for themselves. The lodge was
                almost entirely built with members&apos; voluntary labour and all
                subsequent maintenance, cooking, cleaning and other tasks are
                conducted on the same basis.
