 * the morning, where the club is" — and `node-cron` needs a named zone to turn
 * it into an instant. That zone used to be `APP_TIME_ZONE`, which is
 * `process.env.TZ || NEXT_PUBLIC_TZ || "Pacific/Auckland"`: the CONTAINER's
 * zone. Moving the deployment to another region therefore moved every job, and
 * the epic's rule is the opposite — machine timezone is irrelevant and the
 * club's persisted zone is the sole civil-time authority (`INV-CONFIG-002`).
 *
 * It is resolved ONCE, at boot, before any job is registered. `node-cron` reads
 * the `timezone` option when a job is scheduled and nothing re-reads it
 * afterwards, so a club that changes its timezone through the guarded admin
 * maintenance page keeps the old schedule until the next restart. That is stated
 * here rather than left to be discovered, and it is the same restart-scoped
 * contract the Sentry monitor definitions below already have.

          A CONFIRMED COPY SAYS SO TOO, once, at boot.

          This is the one hole the deploy cannot close. The production deploy
          refuses a `.env` that says non-production and re-reads each container's
          own declaration before the cutover — but a site brought up by hand with
          `docker compose up` runs none of that, comes up as a copy, and holds back
          mail its members are waiting for. Nothing about the DATA can tell that
          case from a legitimate copy: a copy is restored FROM production, so it
          contains exactly the same real members. What can tell them apart is
          somebody reading this line and knowing it is wrong — which is why it
          names the source that decided it, so they know whether to look at the
          `.env` or at /admin/environment rather than guessing between two
          settings whose names differ by one word.

          INFO, NOT WARN, AND THAT WAS MEASURED RATHER THAN PREFERRED. It is not
          a fault — a copy declaring itself a copy is the system working — so
          `warn` would be the wrong volume on its own. It is also the wrong LEVEL
          for a concrete reason: `measurement/current-main-refresh/run-log-noise.sh`
          (MC-09) fails any warning-or-error signature that repeats three times
          across the producer logs, and eight of its eleven producers
          `--force-recreate app` inside their own `docker logs --since` window. So
          one line per boot is one line per producer. Measured by running
          `bin/analyse-log-noise.mjs` over eleven producer logs each holding this
          exact line: at level 40 it reports `count: 11` and THROWS
          `sustained/fatal log noise detected`; at level 30 it passes with zero
          classified lines. The analyser also text-classifies any line containing
          "error", "failed", "warning" or "exception" regardless of level, so the
          sentence below deliberately says "held back" and not "failed".

          Same best-effort try/catch as the UNKNOWN branch above, and the same
          rule about the structured fields: the two source KINDS and the decision,
          never `declaration.raw`, which is operator text.
