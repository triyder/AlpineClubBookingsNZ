 * (module-flag visibility, `fullAdminOnly`, `orAccess`, and the permission
 * matrix) plus the hut-leader relabel, so the palette can never reveal an href
 * an admin is not permitted to open.
 *
 * Superset, not "exactly what the sidebar shows": the index lists every page
 * the sidebar COULD show this admin, which is deliberately more than the
 * sidebar renders at any given moment. The two queue-driven "Needs Attention"
 * deep links (Unpaid Finished Stays / Unpaid Stay Additions) appear here
 * unconditionally — they are useful, always-accessible, pre-filtered views —
 * whereas the sidebar reveals them only while their queue is non-empty. This is
 * never a superset in permission terms: an href the admin may not open is never
 * indexed.
 *
 * Fail-closed: unlike {@link getVisibleAdminNavSections} (whose fail-OPEN
 * missing-matrix contract predates this and is shared with other callers), a
 * missing `permissionMatrix` yields an EMPTY index here, so the search surface
 * denies by default rather than exposing every page — defence in depth (#2092).
 *
 * De-duplication: a handful of hrefs appear twice in `buildAdminNavSections` — once in
 * the queue-driven "Needs Attention" section and once in their natural home
 * section. We key by href and let later (natural) sections overwrite the
 * earlier "Needs Attention" copy, so every page appears exactly once, labelled
 * by its natural section where it has one.
