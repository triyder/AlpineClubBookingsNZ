 * Ask an admin to make a change this member is not allowed to make themselves.

 * Moved out of `edit-booking-panel.tsx` (#2690). Whether it appears at all stays
 * in the panel: the condition reads the edit policy AND the text of the
 * quote/save errors, since a refusal naming a lock is what turns an ordinary
 * edit into a request.
 *
 * #4030: the card names WHO the member is asking to add. It used to be one
 * free-text box, so "can we add these three grandchildren" reached the officer
 * naming nobody, and once the stay finished the approval (#3750) had nothing it
 * could charge. Now the member adds each guest with the guest editor's fields
 * and nights inside the stay, sees what they are estimated to cost, and the
 * note stays as context. The server refuses a request with no structured change.
