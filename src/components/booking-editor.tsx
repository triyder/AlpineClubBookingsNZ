/**
 * The two headline stay dates, spelled out in full — long weekday, long month —
 * because they are the thing the member checks before agreeing to a change, and
 * "Friday 12 June 2026" is harder to misread than "Fri, 12 Jun 2026" (#2264).
 *
 * NO ZONE AT ALL, WHICH IS THE FIX (CT-4, #2870). `checkIn`/`checkOut` are
 * `@db.Date` LODGE NIGHTS — calendar days, which have no timezone — so they are
 * rendered by a calendar-date shape, which takes none. This file used to hold a
 * local `Intl.DateTimeFormat` pinned to UTC over the UTC-midnight encoding, and
 * before that one pinned to `APP_TIME_ZONE`, which was the identity only for a
 * club east of Greenwich; west of it every member's stay dates printed a day
 * early.
 *
 * IT IS ONE CALL NOW because CT-4's `src/lib` group added the missing shape:
 * `HOUSE_SHAPES.longWeekdayDate` is the long weekday, long month AND the year,
 * declared as one shape rather than composed from `longWeekdayDayMonth` plus the
 * year — which is byte-identical for `en-NZ` and not safe for a configurable
 * `APP_LOCALE`.
