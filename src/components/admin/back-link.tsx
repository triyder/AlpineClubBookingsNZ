/**
 * Consistent "back to parent hub" affordance for admin drill-down leaf pages.
 *
 * Renders the same styled link the Booking Policies leaves established so every
 * hub leaf returns to a predictable *static* parent hub (not browser history —
 * important on kiosk/touch where there may be no history to go back to). Pass
 * the parent hub's route as `href` and its human name as `label`; the component
 * prepends the ← affordance and the shared underline styling.
 *
 * RULE (enforced): every admin drill-down leaf page must render `BackLink` to
 * its parent, and be covered by an enforcement suite. Statically renderable
 * leaves live in `src/lib/__tests__/admin-leaf-back-links.test.tsx`; the
 * client-gated leaves that fetch on mount live in the companion RTL suite
 * `src/lib/__tests__/admin-drilldown-back-links-client.test.tsx`. When you add a
 * leaf under an admin hub, add its BackLink here AND extend whichever suite fits
 * its render model — the frozen contract fails if a covered leaf loses its link.
 *
 * Dynamic-parent variant: a few drill-downs sit under a parent that is itself
 * dynamic (an `[id]` record page, or a caller-provided `returnTo`) rather than a
 * fixed hub. `BackLink` already accepts an arbitrary `href`/`label`, so those
 * pages need no new component — resolve the parent route (e.g.
 * `/admin/lodges/${id}`) and pass it as `href`. The static-hub case is the
 * common one; the dynamic-parent case is the documented exception.
