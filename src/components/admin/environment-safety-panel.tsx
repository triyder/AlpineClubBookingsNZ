/**
 * The environment-safety panel (ENV-SAFETY 1, #3034; epic #2986).
 *
 * WHY THIS SURFACE DOES NOT USE `ViewOnlyActionButton` /
 * `AdminViewOnlySectionBanner`, and please do not "fix" it to. Those are the
 * canonical furniture for a section with a VIEW tier and an EDIT tier: they
 * resolve `useAdminAreaEditAccess(area)` and explain that this admin can look but
 * not change, because their access role grants the area at `view`. This screen
 * has exactly one permission level — Full Admin, enforced in the route by
 * `requireAdmin({ permission: false })` — so there is no area-edit tier to
 * describe, and rendering that banner here would state a REASON that is not the
 * reason. `/admin/environment`'s page shell therefore does what
 * `/admin/club-time` and `/admin/config-transfer` do: it tests `isFullAdmin` and
 * shows a short "available to full administrators only" panel instead of this
 * one. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` -> "Admin/member layer" names this as the
 * acknowledged shape for a whole-screen-Full-Admin surface.
 *
 * IT STILL FOLLOWS THE STAGED-EDIT MODEL. The panel mounts READ-ONLY showing
 * what this installation is and which source decided it; changing the override is
 * Switch -> acknowledge -> Save. Nothing persists on a click, and the
 * acknowledgement is not decoration — the API refuses an unconfirmed change, so a
 * caller that skips this panel gets the same refusal.
 *
 * THE BROWSER NEVER DECIDES THE ROLE. Everything shown here arrives from
 * `GET /api/admin/environment-safety`. There is no `process.env` read in this
 * file and there cannot be a useful one: `APP_ENVIRONMENT_ROLE` is deliberately
 * not a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable, so a browser would read `undefined` and report
 * "nothing has declared this installation" while the server read `production`.
 * That is the split-brain second authority INV-CONFIG-003 exists to prevent, and
 * `environment-role-declaration.ts` is a named forbidden leaf in the
 * client/server boundary census for exactly this reason.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SCREEN MAY CLAIM. #3034 recorded and reported the role and this copy
 * said so; #3035 and #3036 are the changes that made the role ACT, so the copy
 * now says what actually happens. A confirmed copy does not email members
 * (#3035, INV-CONFIG-004), and every Xero contact it touches has its email
 * address replaced with a non-deliverable one so Xero cannot email members from
 * a copy either (#3036, INV-CONFIG-005).
 *
 * NOTE WHAT IT STILL MAY NOT CLAIM, because the previous version of this copy
 * was going to be wrong in exactly this way: a copy does NOT "stop writing to
 * the club's real Xero organisation". It keeps writing — invoices, credit notes
 * and contacts, all of it, deliberately, so settlement behaviour stays testable
 * — and what changes is that the contacts can no longer reach anybody. If it is
 * pointed at the club's REAL Xero organisation, containment REWRITES real
 * accounting records, which is why the block below reports how many.

/**
 * The withheld-email sentence.
 *
 * THIS IS THE SIGNAL THAT SEPARATES the two cases nothing else can tell apart: a
 * live club installation that is not sending — because it has been wrongly
 * declared a copy, or left undeclared — and a copy nobody is using. A copy
 * restored from the live database holds the club's real members and their real
 * addresses, so no inspection of the DATA can distinguish them; what distinguishes
 * them is consequence. A real club in either of those states holds back a steady
 * stream of member mail; an idle copy holds back almost nothing.
 *
 * The three states must read differently. "None" and "could not be counted" look
 * identical at a glance and mean opposite things: one says nobody is using this
 * installation, the other says nobody knows. The numbers come from
 * `src/lib/environment-safety-withheld.ts`, which counts what #3035's delivery
 * boundary records.
 *
 * NO SENTENCE HERE MAY NAME ONE STATE'S REASON, because this block renders under
 * two — a confirmed copy and an installation nobody has declared. Telling the
 * operator of an undeclared LIVE site that its mail is held back "because it is
 * treated as a copy" sends them looking for the safer override instead of the
 * missing declaration, and the override is not what is holding their mail. The
 * role is displayed directly above this block and says which state applies; this
 * block says how much and how lately, in words true of both (#3035).
