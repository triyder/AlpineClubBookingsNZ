// #2142 review (round 3): the round-2 fix taught the DEFAULT CANCELLATION
// section that a snapshot is authoritative only for the scope it was loaded for,
// and `AGENTS.md` / `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` now state that as binding. The two
// LIST sections fetched on exactly the same key and did not honour it: their
// `catch` set `error` and left the rows alone, so after a failed switch to a
// lodge the card was retitled "… — Lodge One", said "Periods listed here belong
// to Lodge One", and left Edit, Delete (a HARD delete, for periods) and
// Activate/Deactivate live over rows that were still the CLUB-WIDE set. Every
// one of those buttons acts on a row id, so they hit club-wide rows the admin
// believed they had navigated away from — strictly worse than the cancellation
// defect the same change had just fixed.
//
// These tests pin the same invariant in both list sections: a mismatch between
// the scope on screen and the scope the rows were loaded for is UNKNOWN — no
// rows, no editor, no destructive affordances — until a load for the current
// scope succeeds.
