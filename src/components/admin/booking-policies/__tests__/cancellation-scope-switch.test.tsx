// #2142 review: the rest of this suite mocks `useLodgeOptions` to ZERO lodges,
// so `PolicyScopeSelect` renders nothing and no scope-switch path is exercised
// at all. That gap hid a real defect: `useSectionEditState` leaves `saved` and
// `draft` untouched when a load FAILS, and this PR newly DERIVES two decisions
// from `saved` — whether a lodge has an override, and whether the first-save
// exception applies. After a failed scope switch the snapshot still describes
// the PREVIOUS partition, so those derivations were being made from a value
// that says nothing about the lodge on screen.
//
// The invariant these tests pin: a snapshot is authoritative ONLY for the scope
// it was loaded for. A mismatch means "unknown" — no editor, no override
// affordances, no first-save exception — until a load for the current scope
// succeeds.
