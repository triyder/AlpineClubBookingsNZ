/**
 * The three cards' drafts (#2162, #2166).
 *
 * All five settings live in ONE server-side row behind ONE whole-object PUT, so
 * a single `useSectionEditState` instance for the whole section would match the
 * storage exactly. It still cannot be used, and the reason survived the #2166
 * decision to Edit-gate the timing cards: the hook carries ONE `editing` flag,
 * and three cards sharing it would mean one Edit unlocking all three, one
 * Cancel discarding all three drafts, and one Save writing all five fields. The
 * owner decision in #2166 was explicitly per-card Edit gating, NOT a
 * section-level Edit — so each card keeps its own instance, its own Edit, its
 * own dirty gate, and its own Cancel.
 *
 * The price of three instances is the shared write object, and it is paid the
 * documented way (`AGENTS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`): every save GETs the
 * fresh settings and merges only the fields the ADMIN CHANGED, exactly as the
 * magic-link and Google cards do against `PUT /api/admin/modules`. Merging only
 * its own fields would be enough to stop a card writing a sibling's UNSAVED
 * draft or its own stale snapshot of one; narrowing further to the changed
 * fields is what stops a card reverting a field it owns but the admin never
 * touched (see {@link changedTimingFields}).
 *
 * The two timing drafts hold STRINGS, because their editors are free-text
 * number boxes an admin can legitimately leave mid-typed ("", "1", "0"). They
 * are declared as type aliases rather than interfaces so they carry the
 * implicit index signature {@link isTimingDirty} needs.

    #2166: `beginSaveDraftSync` is GONE, and nothing replaces it.

    It existed because every card wrote through ONE shared `settings` snapshot
    that every save re-seeded from its fresh read. That read can legitimately
    move a field this admin never touched, so a sibling card's untouched draft
    box could end up disagreeing with the snapshot its dirty flag compared
    against — arming a Save nobody armed, one click from silently reverting the
    other admin.

    There is no shared snapshot any more. Each card's draft and snapshot live in
    its own hook instance and are only ever re-seeded TOGETHER, by that card's
    own load or its own save. No card's save can leave a sibling dirty, so the
    hazard is structurally impossible rather than defended against.

    What is left is display staleness: a card the admin did not touch still
    shows the values it loaded with, even after a sibling's save re-read the row
    and found that a second admin has moved them. That is the same accepted
    property the module-toggle cards on `/admin/security` have. Be precise about
    what does and does not follow from it:

      - `startEditing` is `setEditing(true)` and NOTHING else. Opening a card
        does not re-fetch, so clicking Edit does not resolve the staleness. The
        boxes an admin starts typing into can already be out of date.
      - What keeps that from becoming a WRITE is the per-field patch: a stale
        box the admin never touched is not in the PUT body at all, so it cannot
        revert anyone. Only a field they actually changed is written, and that
        one they saw.
      - The dirty gate is against this card's own snapshot, which is what is on
        screen — so a stale box never arms Save on its own either.

    Do NOT "fix" the staleness by having one card's save re-seed another card's
    state: that is the coupling this removed.

              defers the explanation to the section banner above (a disabled button
