/**
 * The member-guest policy card on Admin › Bookings setup ("+ Add Member
 * Guest", epic #2305, MG2 #2307; owner decisions D-3, D-17, D-18 and MG2-M-1/
 * MG2-M-4 as ticked, 30 Jul).
 *
 * MG2-M-1: this lives on the existing Bookings setup page beside the other
 * booking-policy configuration — deliberately NOT its own admin route, which
 * would cost the whole registry fan-out (sidebar, route-area matrix, feature
 * search, command palette) for one card.
 *
 * MG2-M-4: the card stays EDITABLE while the module is off, with a banner
 * saying nothing is in use, so a club can configure the policy first and then
 * switch the feature on. View-only is a real third state (the shared
 * banner + ViewOnlyActionButton pattern), never a Save that 403s.
 *
 * Follows the canonical settings-section pattern (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` →
 * "Admin/member layer", where it is stated in full; `group-discount-section.tsx`
 * is the reference): loads read-only, Edit reveals Save/Cancel, Cancel reverts to
 * the saved snapshot, Save persists once and re-seeds from the server response.
 *
 * The two name-search toggles carry the privacy warnings the owner accepted
 * verbatim on the mockup pack, and per D-18 neither value ever travels in club
 * config transfer — this card (backed by its admin route) is the only way they
 * change.
 *
 * THOSE TWO TOGGLES ARE LIVE AS OF MG3 (#2308). They shipped in MG2 saved but
 * read by nothing, and the card carried a paragraph saying so in as many words
 * — the honest copy that stopped a privacy decision being armed once and taking
 * effect a release later with nobody re-deciding it. MG3 gives both values a
 * reader (the member finder in the booking wizard), so that paragraph became
 * false and was removed in the same change, which is exactly the promise
 * src/lib/member-guest-settings.ts made when it was written.
 *
 * What did NOT change is the two warnings themselves. They describe what the
 * switches actually do — turning open search on makes the membership list
 * browsable, and including under-18s makes children's names browsable — and
 * they are pinned by a test precisely so that a later editor cannot soften them
 * into something more comfortable.
