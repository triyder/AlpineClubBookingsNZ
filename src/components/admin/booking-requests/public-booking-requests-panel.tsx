    ADR-002's "no lodge copy in a single-lodge club" rule is applied SERVER-side

    nulls the name below two), which is the only place it can be applied

    was wrong in both directions:

      - too closed: `/api/admin/lodges` then needed `lodge:view`, which
        `ADMIN_MEMBERSHIP` and `FINANCE_ADMIN` lack, so a multi-lodge club's
        officer queue rendered with no lodge on a MUTATION surface. #2925
        relaxed that route; this still belongs server-side regardless;
      - too open: once this PR made the whole-lodge form always send the sole
        lodge id, new single-lodge rows carry a real name, so a genuine
        single-lodge club would have shown a permanent badge.

    One rule, one place, and the client stops guessing.

    each disabled button below (and instead of repeating it inside every request
    card). The `role="status"` wrapper is permanently mounted so the live region
    is registered in the accessibility tree before its content appears; a region
    injected already-populated is silently dropped by some
    screen-reader/browser pairings. It sits OUTSIDE the `space-y-*` stack so the
