 * What a copy has done to the club's Xero contacts, on `/admin/environment`
 * (ENV-SAFETY 3, #3036; epic #2986; INV-CONFIG-005).
 *
 * SPLIT OUT OF `environment-safety-panel.tsx` because the panel outgrew its
 * file-size budget once this block gained the addressable list, and because the
 * block is genuinely a separate subject: the panel says which installation this
 * is and who set the override, and this says how much of the club's accounting
 * has been edited and what to do about it. The panel renders it and passes in
 * the four facts it needs; the types live here, and the panel imports them for
 * its own payload shape.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SCREEN MAY CLAIM. #3034 recorded and reported the role; #3035 and
 * #3036 are the changes that made the role ACT, so this copy says what actually
 * happens. It may NOT claim that a copy leaves the club's real Xero organisation
 * alone — a previous draft did. It keeps writing: invoices, credit notes
 * and contacts, all of it, deliberately, so settlement behaviour stays testable.
 * What changes is that the contacts can no longer reach anybody, and if it is
 * pointed at the club's REAL organisation, containment REWRITES real accounting
 * records — which is why this block reports how many, and which.

 * the club's accounting it has edited. On an UNDECLARED installation containment
 * is NOT running and nothing is being WRITTEN to Xero at all, and a count of zero
 * there means "nothing has happened", not "nothing needed to happen". One
 * sentence for both would tell the operator of an undeclared LIVE site that their
 * Xero is fine when in fact their invoicing has stopped.
 *
 * WRITES, NOT READS, and the distinction is deliberate. Reading from Xero still
 * works while the role is unresolved — the contact and invoice screens still
 * load, which is what an operator diagnosing this needs. A read changes nothing
 * in the club's books and cannot make Xero email anybody.
 *
 * THE UNKNOWN BRANCH HAS TWO CASES, because the repair differs and the obvious
 * single sentence is wrong for one of them. An installation that has DECLARED
 * itself production still resolves UNKNOWN when the safer override cannot be read
 * from the database — deliberate #3034 fail-closed behaviour — and telling that
 * operator to "declare the role" sends them to fix something already correct.
 *
 * IT NAMES NO EMAIL ADDRESS, and cannot: the payload carries counts, instants,
 * member names and Xero contact ids.

 * not exist. The earlier version of this screen told the operator to "re-sync
 * those members from the live site", and no shipped route does that: the admin
 * force-sync links a contact rather than pushing an address to it, the Xero push
 * refuses an already-linked member, and the contact update only fires when a
 * LOCAL field changes — none of them compares what Xero holds against what the
 * database holds. Nor could the copy repair this itself: writing a member's real
 * address back to Xero is exactly what containment exists to prevent, and it
 * would re-arm the reminders. And the live site cannot find the damage on its
 * own, because the record of what this copy changed is in THIS database.
 *
 * So the repair is: correct each contact in Xero, reading the right address off
 * the member's page on the club's live site. The list below gives the operator
 * the two things that makes possible — which contact, and whose it is.
