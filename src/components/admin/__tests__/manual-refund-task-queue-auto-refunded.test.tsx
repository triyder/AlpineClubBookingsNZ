/**
 * #2750 — the operator surface for a refund nobody decided.
 *
 * A modification payment captured against a booking the club has already deleted
 * is refunded in full by the #1350 Stripe webhook, and #2700 made that leave a
 * `ManualRefundTask` behind, which the webhook then closes itself as DISMISSED
 * because there is genuinely nothing left to hand back. #2750 kept the automatic
 * refund — the member's money going back is the safe direction when nobody is
 * watching — and fixed the half that was missing: a closed row appeared on no
 * screen at all, because this queue lists OPEN rows.
 *
 * The card is named here, which is the issue's acceptance criterion: the finance
 * queue on `/admin/payments`, `data-testid="automatic-refund-notices"`.
 *
 * COMPLETE SINCE #2760, AND GROUPED. The webhook now writes the DISMISSED row
 * itself when nothing raised one, and does it for a booking that is cancelled but
 * not deleted as well — so the card is the list rather than one ordering's worth
 * of it, and the "this card does not catch every one" paragraph is gone. What
 * replaces it says the card covers the last thirty days and names the audit log as
 * the permanent record for anything older. The rows are split into two groups
 * because the widening added rows for what is usually normal operation, and those
 * would otherwise bury the case that needs a person: a refund on a booking the
 * club DELETED.
 *
 * MUTATION PROOF. Return the automatic refunds as part of `tasks` instead of
 * their own list and "never renders an automatic refund with a button" fails.
 * Keep the component's original `tasks.length === 0` early return and "shows the
 * record even when nothing is waiting to be paid back by hand" fails. Drop the
 * note or the reason from the row and "says both what happened and that the money
 * has already gone" fails. Render the card on an empty list and "renders nothing
 * at all when there is neither work nor a record" fails. Claim the card is
 * complete for all time and "names the audit log as the record beyond its window"
 * fails; put a `View booking` link back on a record row and "offers no booking
 * link on a record row" fails; blank the screen silently on a failed or degraded
 * read and the two "could not be loaded" tests fail. Merge the two groups into one
 * list and "separates a deleted booking from one that is merely cancelled" fails;
 * print the cancelled group first and "puts the deleted group first" fails.
