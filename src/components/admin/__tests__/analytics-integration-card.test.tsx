/**
 * The Google Analytics card on Admin -> Integrations (#2573).
 *
 * This file exists because the wording on this card is not decoration: owner decision
 * section 10 mandates the privacy warning AND the closing disclaimer, section 4
 * mandates a warning shown as soon as banner-off is SELECTED (before Save), section 3
 * asks for banner-on to be marked as recommended, and clarification 2 requires "Ask
 * visitors to choose again" to be unavailable in banner-off mode. None of that was
 * pinned anywhere: the E2E drives the settings through the API and never opens this
 * card, so a refactor could have removed the disclaimer or moved the banner-off
 * warning behind a post-save state with the whole suite still green.
 *
 * The load-failure case is here for the same reason — the card is the only place that
 * state is reachable from.
