/**
 * School group booking request variant (issue #709).
 *
 * Built on the #707 `BookingRequest` infrastructure rather than a parallel
 * intake: a SCHOOL request reuses the same email-verification step and admin
 * queue. The differences live here.
 *
 * Locked decisions:
 *   - The booking confirms at approval (CONFIRMED, capacity held) and flips to
 *     PAID when the Xero invoice is paid. CONFIRMED holds capacity via
 *     CAPACITY_HOLDING_BOOKING_STATUSES (src/lib/booking-status.ts).
 *   - The school is the invoiced party / Xero contact. The booking is owned by
 *     a non-login Member named after the school (canLogin: false), mirroring
 *     the xero-member-import pattern. The teacher(s) become separate non-login
 *     Members with a HutLeaderAssignment and PIN email.
 *   - Pay-on-account uses the existing INTERNET_BANKING payment source so the
 *     existing line-item builder emails the invoice and the existing inbound
 *     reconciliation marks the booking PAID when the invoice is paid. No new
 *     tax logic is introduced.
 *
 * Conventions: money stays integer cents, booking dates stay NZ date-only,
 * only SHA-256 token hashes are stored, and external calls (email, Xero outbox)
 * run after the transaction commits.

 * Resolve a school request's guest list against an officer's adjusted child

 * the price and a different one at the beds, which is exactly the defect #3412
 * fixes: Save quote priced the STORED list while the panel showed the adjusted
 * total, so a group agreed down to 20 was quoted for 29.
 *
 * What it guarantees, in order:
 *
 * - **#2342: the stored guests are strict-read unconditionally**, even when the
 *   counts replace them. Skipping that parse would make a request whose stored
 *   list cannot be read back priceable, capacity-checkable and invoiceable from
 *   admin-typed numbers alone — and the panel prefills those numbers from the
 *   SALVAGED list, in which an unreadable age tier counts as zero, so a 30-child
 *   request could be invoiced for two people. A row we cannot read is not
 *   convertible by any route: decline it, or repair the stored data.
 * - **The named teachers/parent helpers are preserved** and stay first in the
 *   list; only the bulk children are regenerated (`generateSchoolGuests`).
 * - **Lodge capacity binds the new list** — `INV-CAP`, through the one helper
 *   all three school doors share (`assertSchoolGuestsWithinLodgeCapacity`).
 *   This is the static bed count of the lodge, not a per-night availability
 *   read: no beds are held here and no capacity lock is taken, because nothing
 *   in this function reserves anything. The per-night check stays where the
 *   reservation is (`holdBookingRequestSlots`, and approval's re-check —
 *   `INV-ADDPAY-008`).
 * - **A member linked to a row the regeneration renumbers is refused (422).**
 *   Children are regenerated as numbered placeholders, so a link stored against
 *   child #7 would come to mean a DIFFERENT child once the list is renumbered,
 *   and that member would then be priced as a member, invoiced and emailed onto
 *   somebody else's bed. It lives HERE, not in one caller, because both callers
 *   apply the link POSITIONALLY against the regenerated list — approve as much
 *   as quote — so a refusal in the quote service alone left approve doing by
 *   design the thing the refusal exists to prevent, with no new condition on
 *   the Approve button to stop it.
 *
 * `changed` is the answer to "does persisting this rewrite the party?", and it
 * is false for an override that types the current numbers back — which the
 * panel sends whenever the officer touched a box at all. Nothing is refused
 * when it is false: an unchanged list renumbers nobody.

        #3367 (stage 2 of programme #2912) — THE SCHOOL BECOMES A RECORD OF ITS
        OWN, and from this release it is the invoiced and contacted party.

        Resolved or created HERE, inside the approval transaction and under the
        locks it already holds. The canonical GLOBAL advisory lock taken at the
        top of this transaction is the unique-name claim: two admins approving
        two requests for one school are serialised by it, so the
        read-then-create inside `resolveOrCreateSchoolOrganisation` cannot
        interleave and mint two schools for one name. A repeat school resolves to
        the record it already has, and therefore to the Xero customer it already

        `Role.SCHOOL` literal the teachers below still carry. Stage 2 adds the

          #3367: the REAL TEACHER, recorded against the school as a person
          rather than the school being invented as a person.

          This is the row the school's Xero contact reads to name a contact
          person on it (owner decision, 13 September 2026) — so a treasurer can
          see who to talk to without leaving Xero. When a school's teacher
          changes, the next approval writes a new row here and the next Xero
          contact resolution pushes it; `organisation-xero-contacts.ts` holds the
          full answer.

          `upsert`, not `create`: the same teacher returning with the same school
          is the ordinary case, and `@@unique([organisationId, memberId])` would
          otherwise abort an approval over an association that is already true.
          A teacher member is created fresh per approval today, so in practice
          this inserts; the upsert is what keeps that an implementation detail
          rather than a constraint this code depends on.

          WRITING THE NEW ROWS IS ONLY HALF OF IT. Because a fresh teacher
          `Member` is minted on every approval — even for the same returning
          human — an approval that only ever added rows would accumulate one
          association per approval and never remove one, and the derived contact
          list would name people who left years ago. The other half is
          `reconcileOrganisationTeachers` after this loop.

          THE TEACHER STILL CARRIES `Role.SCHOOL` above. That is not an oversight
          and a reader who notices it deserves the reason: the owner declined
          changing it in this stage (13 September 2026, choice B) because a
          teacher's `HutLeaderAssignment` is tied to this area and the schema
          warns that reclassifying a member can silently remove a live
          assignment. Stage 4 (#3369) retires the role vocabulary in one step,
          together with the invented school member. A Xero contact person is a
          name and an address, not a role, so the two facts do not conflict.

        #3367: the school's TEACHER associations are RECONCILED to this

        Without this the rows accumulate one set per approval and nothing in the
        tree ever removes one — the model has no end-date column — so the
        school's Xero contact would eventually name five people who have gone
        and could never be corrected. The owner took decision A (13 September
        2026) on the stated promise that a departed teacher is corrected on the
        next invoice; this is what makes that promise true rather than a hope.

        Safe to delete rather than end-date because `OrganisationContact` is
        pure association and says so in its own schema docblock: "it carries no
        history of its own". The history a school's teachers DO have lives on
        `HutLeaderAssignment`, created above, which is a separate record and is
        never touched here.

        A request that recorded no teachers reconciles nothing — see
        `reconcileOrganisationTeachers`.

 * Approve a signed-in member's whole-lodge request (#2263), converting it into a
 * CONFIRMED booking that holds the whole lodge.
 *
 * This lives beside `approveSchoolBookingRequest` on purpose (binding owner
 * decision): the hold-vs-capacity-lock ordering, the `exclusiveHoldData`
 * stamping, the idempotency claim, the ADR-001 bed-allocation prune (#2285) and
 * the post-commit conflict surfacing exist in ONE place, so a correction to any
 * of them cannot land on the school path and miss this one.
 *
 * School parity, deliberately:
 *   - the booking is created **CONFIRMED**, which is capacity-holding in its own
 *     right (CAPACITY_HOLDING_BOOKING_STATUSES) — no dependence on the PENDING
 *     `originBookingRequest` clause;
 *   - the MONEY is where the two paths now part (fork, booking-fixes). With
 *     the Internet Banking AND Xero modules on, the approval leaves the payment
 *     method to the MEMBER, exactly as an ordinary card booking does: no
 *     Payment row is minted and nothing is invoiced here. The booking page then
 *     shows the ordinary Complete Payment card — card payment, with whatever
 *     account credit the member asked for on the request already applied — and
 *     the "pay by internet banking instead" switch, which mints the receivable
 *     and raises the Xero invoice through the one switch route every card
 *     booking uses (`/api/payments/switch-to-internet-banking`). Credit the
 *     member asked for is applied inside this transaction, under the member's
 *     ledger lock, taken AFTER the global and lodge keys (INV-LOCK-002); credit
 *     that covers the whole price settles the booking PAID at $0 here, as the
 *     ordinary create path does, because there is no card amount left to mint.
 *     With either module off there is no switch for the member to make, so the
 *     approval keeps the LEGACY shape: `paymentSource: INTERNET_BANKING` with a
 *     PENDING Payment row, so the finance surfaces see the receivable, and —
 *     like every sibling path that creates one — that receivable is INVOICED
 *     post-commit: the Xero invoice operation plus the #1620 applied-credit
 *     allocation when the module is on, the delivery-locked manual-invoice
 *     admin alert when it is off. An unpaid confirmed booking that nobody was
 *     ever asked to invoice is money the club silently never collects;
 *   - `hasNonMembers: true`, because the placeholder guests are rated
 *     NON_MEMBER (owner decision OD-A: conservative revenue default; guests
 *     re-rate per-guest through the ordinary booking-modification path as real
 *     names and member links are edited in).
 *
 * School DIVERGENCE, deliberately:
 *   - the booking is owned by the REQUESTING LOGIN MEMBER. No non-login member
 *     is minted, no teachers, no PINs, no school Xero contact, and there is no
 *     owner-substitution path to run (the owner is a live account, not a
 *     materialised contact).
 *   - NO `PaymentLink` row and NO tokenised payment-link email. That flow is the
 *     GENERAL *non-login* approval path; a member pays through the member
 *     booking surfaces they are already signed in to. The confirmation email
 *     therefore has to carry the internet-banking reference itself, and it says
 *     the amount is OWING — never "Total Paid" — because nothing has been paid.
 *   - NO `nonMemberHoldUntil`. The hold clock belongs to the PENDING
 *     non-member path (it is what the bump cron reads); a CONFIRMED booking has
 *     already been admitted, exactly as a school booking has. Stamping a hold
 *     deadline onto a CONFIRMED booking that holds the WHOLE LODGE would arm a
 *     bump clock against the one booking that must not be bumped.

    // `paymentDue` is what makes it TRUE: this booking is CONFIRMED but nothing
    // has been paid, so the message must not say "Total Paid" or "Payment has
    // been processed successfully". Where the member chooses the method it
    // says the amount owing and points at the booking page (`payOnline`); on
    // the legacy receivable it states the internet-banking reference (there
    // is no PaymentLink to send them to) and only claims an invoice was emailed
    // when one actually was. A booking the member's credit settled in full is
    // PAID, so it gets the ordinary paid confirmation, which reads the applied
    // credit from the ledger itself (#2328).
    //
    // Sent to the OWNER's live account email, not the request-time snapshot: the
    // booking belongs to a live account whose address may have changed since the
    // request was submitted, and the request snapshot is a historical record.
    // Falls back to the snapshot only if the lookup fails.
