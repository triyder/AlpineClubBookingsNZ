 *
 * When `resolveTokens` is set, text tokens such as {{club-name}} are
 * replaced after sanitising; resolveTextTokens HTML-escapes every
 * replacement value, so resolution cannot reintroduce unsafe markup.
 * Reader/kiosk routes resolve tokens; the admin editor route must not,
 * so editors round-trip the literal {{token}} text.
