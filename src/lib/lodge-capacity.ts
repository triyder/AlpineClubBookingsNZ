/**
 * Capacity for one lodge on one night. Never sums beds across lodges

 *
 * Resolution order (see docs/CAPACITY_MODEL.md for the full scenario table):
 * 1. Bed Allocation module ON with ≥1 active bed: the physical bed inventory
 *    is the placement set, and the admin capacity value acts as a *maximum
 *    sleeping capacity* ceiling on top of it. Effective capacity is the LOWER
 *    of the two — a lodge may have more beds installed than it is licensed to
 *    sleep (#1653). No capacity set (or set ≥ bed count) → the bed count wins
 *    ("configured_beds"); a capacity below the bed count caps it ("capped_beds").
 * 2. Otherwise (module off, or on with no active beds): the admin capacity
 *    value for this lodge (the per-lodge `LodgeSettings.capacity` override,
 *    source "capacity_override").
 * 3. Neither → 0 ("unconfigured_lodge"), for EVERY lodge including the default.
 *    Since #1982 the DB is the sole runtime source: the default lodge carries
 *    an explicit `LodgeSettings.capacity` backfilled from the club-config bed
 *    total by the boot-time self-heal (`config-self-heal.ts`), so it normally
 *    resolves via step 2. A default lodge that still resolves to 0 here is
 *    genuinely unconfigured (no beds AND no override — e.g. a fork whose boot
 *    self-heal was skipped) and is flagged loudly by the setup-readiness
 *    club-config check rather than being handed phantom capacity that could
 *    silently overbook. `club.json` is never read here.
