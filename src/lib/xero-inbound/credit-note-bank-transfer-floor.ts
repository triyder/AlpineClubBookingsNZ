 * #4230 (owner decision 22 Oct 2026, `INV-ADDPAY-021`): what the floor's alert

 * alert never fires while a voided refund note waits for the nightly follow-up
 * (`hasVoidAwaitingFollowUp`, below), so the cause it usually means is a refund
 * whose note was never raised: a later refund on a bank-transfer payment can be
 * counted under the payment's first refund note instead of getting its own
 * (#4287). A void reaches it only once the follow-up or a person has answered
 * it (a marker on the note's link) with the cash still recorded, and its
 * replacement comes from that answer, never by hand. The one wording, shown in
 * the alert and quoted by the Xero guide's troubleshooting row, which a test
 * holds to this constant.

 * on the payment waits for that follow-up, which is the expected divergence.
 * What the alert advises is `BANK_TRANSFER_REFUND_SHORTFALL_ADVICE`.
 * A total already below its detail is never raised here; one above it may
 * still come down to it. Any other source passes through untouched.
