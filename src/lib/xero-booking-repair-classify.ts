// Per-booking finding/action classification for the booking-vs-Xero repair
// tool. classifyBookingContext is a single sequential function that mutates
// its own local findings/actionMap accumulators and is kept whole (one
// function, one module), exceeding the ~700-LOC soft cap. Originally
// extracted verbatim from xero-booking-repair.ts under #1208 item 2's
// behavior-preserving-move rule; that one-off extraction constraint no
// longer binds — the body has since gained behavior deliberately (#1356
// supplementary-invoice arms, #1427 evidence-first credit-note sizing).
