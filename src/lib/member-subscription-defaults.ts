 * #2149 F1: this used to key on a hand-maintained role set
 * (`SUBSCRIPTION_NOT_REQUIRED_ROLES`), a parallel role authority that contradicted
 * the PR's headline principle (membership TYPE is the sole subscription
 * authority; role carries no exemption of its own). A new member has no explicit
 * season assignment yet, so their effective type is the role's built-in default
 * (`defaultMembershipTypeKeyForRole` via `effectiveSubscriptionBehavior(null,
 * role)`) — the SAME shared resolver every read surface, the booking gate, and the
 * Xero sync use. For every real `Role` enum value this is byte-identical to the
 * retired role-set check (ADMIN/LODGE/SCHOOL/NON_MEMBER → NOT_REQUIRED built-ins,
 * USER → FULL/REQUIRED), so creation behaviour is unchanged — but the seed no
 * longer encodes its own role authority.
 *
 * Never overwrites an existing row (`update: {}`), so re-runs are no-ops.

/**
 * Reconcile a member's MemberSubscription row for one season after a seasonal
 * membership-type ASSIGNMENT change, so a stale creation-seeded NOT_REQUIRED row
 * cannot outlive the assignment that supersedes it (#2149 F1).
 *
 * Scenario: an operational account (e.g. role=ADMIN) is seeded a NOT_REQUIRED
 * season row at creation, then later given a REQUIRED-type season assignment. The
 * booking gate and the annual-fee sweep both treat that member as owing, but the
 * seeded NOT_REQUIRED row still reads "Not Required" on the member detail page,
 * the subscription-history table, and the members list — display and enforcement
 * disagree until the next Xero sync / sweep re-derives (and never, if enforcement
 * is off). This flips the row to the sweep's canonical un-invoiced status.
 *
 * Scope — deliberately ONLY the REQUIRED direction (mirrors the annual-fee sweep,
 * does not exceed it):
 *   - REQUIRED: the sweep bills EVERY member on a REQUIRED type as NOT_INVOICED
 *     (its `create` status is `NOT_INVOICED`, independent of age tier), and the
 *     booking gate treats them as owing. Flipping the stale NOT_REQUIRED row to
 *     NOT_INVOICED is exactly that canonical state — no new divergence. The
 *     booking gate's age-tier / Xero-enforcement leniency is the same booking-only
 *     bypass display surfaces already omit (see
 *     `isSubscriptionNotRequiredForMembershipType`).
 *   - BASED_ON_AGE_TIER: NOT reconciled. A NOT_REQUIRED current-season row is the
 *     AUTHORITATIVE season-start exemption (#2041) that the booking gate AND every
 *     display surface already honour — they agree, so there is no inconsistency to
 *     fix, and flipping it would destroy that exemption.
 *   - NOT_REQUIRED: already consistent; nothing to do.
 *
 * The write is a narrow, idempotent, status-guarded `updateMany` — the same
 * classification as the Xero sync's `writeXeroDerivedSubscriptionState`: no
 * advisory lock is required because the WHERE guard makes clobbering structurally
 * impossible (it never touches a paid, invoiced, charge/family-covered, or
 * manually-marked row) and a second run matches nothing. It performs NO provider
 * calls, so it is safe to run inside the caller's assignment transaction.
