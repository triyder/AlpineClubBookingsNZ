/**
 * Booking-side integration for the adult-member hosting policy (#2364).
 *
 * The evaluator in `policies/adult-member-hosting.ts` is pure; this module is
 * the only place that turns a persisted booking into evaluator input and turns
 * the answer back into review state. Keeping it in one place is what makes the
 * "any change re-evaluates" requirement tractable: every booking mutation calls
 * `reconcileAdultMemberHostingReviewWithSiblings`, and none of them has to
 * understand the rule.
 *
 * The reconciler is IDEMPOTENT and derives everything from live rows, so calling
 * it twice, or from a path that changed nothing, is a no-op that writes nothing.
 * That is deliberate — it means a new call site can be added anywhere without
 * having to reason about what the previous one did.
 *
 * WHICH ENTRY POINT TO CALL. `reconcileAdultMemberHostingReview` answers for ONE
 * booking id. That is not enough for a mutator, because `loadSiblingHosts` makes
 * a split child's answer a function of its PARENT's rows: shortening the
 * member's own stay on the parent removes a host from the child, and extending
 * it restores one, without a single row on the child changing. A mutator that
 * reconciled only the id it was handed would therefore leave the other half of a
 * #738 split pair asserting facts that are no longer true — in both directions,
 * defeating hazard detection AND the issue's automatic clear. Every mutation
 * path calls `reconcileAdultMemberHostingReviewWithSiblings`; the single-id form
 * is for callers that already hold every id in the family and reconcile each one
 * deliberately (booking creation, which must attach an admin's decision to the
 * right row).
 */

/**
 * The narrow client this service needs; a `Prisma.TransactionClient` satisfies it.
 *
 * The member/subscription/membership-type delegates are #2543's: under a club
 * running `NON_MEMBER_PRICING` a member with an unpaid subscription stops
 * counting as a host, and that fact has to be read before the evaluator runs.
 * They are part of the required shape rather than optional because a caller that
 * quietly could not read them would silently restore the unpaid member as a
 * host — a rule that is off when nobody notices is worse than no rule.

 * The qualifying-adult-member candidates attending ANOTHER eligible booking on the

 *
 *  - `hostScope: "SAME_BOOKING_OWNER"` — the evaluator counts them only where the
 *    club has that scope switched on. That is the seam #2569 left, used exactly as
 *    intended: no branch of the rule changed to add this scope.
 *  - `hostOnly: true` — their own nights are NOT this booking's responsibility.
 *    This is also §15's capacity answer: the adult member's REAL attendance on
 *    their own booking is recognised as evidence here, and they are never
 *    duplicated as a guest on this one, so no bed is double-counted.
 *  - the participant shape is `toHostingParticipants`' — the same live Member
 *    facts, the same sparse `BookingGuestNight` nights, the same D-12 consent
 *    predicate. §13 forbids a second definition of a qualifying adult member and
 *    there is none: whether these people actually qualify is decided afterwards by
 *    `participantQualifiesAsHost`, exactly as for the booking's own guests.
 *
 * THE GUEST READ IS NARROWED TO MEMBER-LINKED ROWS, which is a true narrowing
 * rather than a policy: a guest with no Member link can never host under any
 * scope, so loading a source booking's non-member guests would be loading rows the
 * evaluator is guaranteed to ignore. Their own nights are that booking's problem
 * and are judged when that booking is reconciled.
 *
 * SPLIT SIBLINGS ARE EXCLUDED, deliberately. A #738 split pair is one party the
 * database stores as two rows, and the invariant is that such a sibling supplies
 * cover under `SAME_BOOKING` — not as "another booking at the lodge". Loading it
 * here as well would put one person in the participant list twice and would make
 * the same-booking half of the rule reachable through the same-owner half.

 * uncovered the change is REFUSED with
 * `SameOwnerCoverageWouldBreakError`, thrown from inside the caller's transaction
 * so the change rolls back and the member is told which of their bookings, which
 * lodge and which nights.
 *
 * `ESCALATE` — the §7 and §8 answer. The change is allowed, and the bounded
 * re-evaluation work it implies is recorded durably in the SAME transaction; after
 * commit the drain re-reads the facts, opens or updates an urgent compliance
 * incident for anything newly uncovered, and notifies the owner and the officer
 * queue. Nothing is cancelled and no beds or payments move.
 *
 * `REQUIRE_OVERRIDE` — the §7 CONFIRMATION STEP for an authorised officer. The
 * dependent bookings are re-evaluated exactly as under `BLOCK`, and if the change
 * would strand one the officer is answered with
 * `SameOwnerCoverageOverrideRequiredError` naming the affected bookings and nights.
 * That is not a block on their change: it is a block on the UNCONFIRMED one. They
 * re-submit with `hostingCoverageOverride`, which produces `ESCALATE` carrying
 * `OFFICER_OVERRIDE` and their mandatory reason. Where nothing would be stranded it
 * behaves identically to `ESCALATE`, so the confirmation is asked for only when
 * there is something to confirm.
 *
 * `ESCALATE` IS THE DEFAULT, and that is the opposite choice from `enforcement`
 * above — deliberately, because the failure directions are opposite. A path that
 * inherits `REFUSE` and should not have been enforced merely annoys somebody; a
 * path that inherited `BLOCK` and should not have would ROLL BACK an authoritative
 * change — a membership lapse, an administrative cancellation, a payment-lifecycle
 * transition, a cron sweep — which §8 forbids in as many words and which would
 * wedge the system rather than protect anybody. `ESCALATE` is never silence: it
 * produces a durable incident, an officer-queue entry, an audit trail and an owner
 * notification.
 *
 * IT IS ALSO WHY `REQUIRE_OVERRIDE` IS NOT THE DEFAULT. §8's list of changes that
 * cannot reasonably be blocked includes every automated path, and those never go
 * through `hostingCoverageActorOptions` — they call this module with the default, so
 * they can never be refused for want of a confirmation nobody is there to give.
 *
 * The member self-service paths therefore pass `BLOCK` explicitly, and
 * `adult-member-hosting-call-sites.test.ts` pins that set tree-wide so a new
 * member-facing edit route cannot quietly inherit the escalating behaviour.

 * it.
 *
 * THE RULE, straight from the owner's text:
 *
 *  - AN ORDINARY MEMBER'S SELF-SERVICE CHANGE IS BLOCKED (§6). They are told which
 *    of their own bookings, which lodge and which nights, and directed to amend
 *    that booking, restore alternative cover, or contact a Booking Officer.
 *  - AN AUTHORISED OFFICER'S CHANGE IS ALLOWED AND ESCALATED (§7, §8). §8 lists
 *    "authorised officer action" among the changes that cannot reasonably be
 *    blocked, and §7 describes what must happen instead: the affected booking stays
 *    confirmed with its beds and payments, gets an urgent compliance incident, the
 *    owner is notified, and the whole thing is audited. Refusing an officer would
 *    also be circular — they are the authority the member's refusal points to.
 *
 * WHERE THE OFFICER'S REASON COMES FROM (§7). It is not inferred and it is never
 * invented: the surface has to have captured an explicit confirmation and a reason,
 * which every officer-capable route now accepts as `hostingCoverageOverride` — the
 * same shape the `no-emails` route uses for an acknowledged admin action. With one,
 * the change escalates as `OFFICER_OVERRIDE` recorded against the officer's member
 * id with their reason on the incident. Without one, the officer is ASKED for it: the
 * disposition is `REQUIRE_OVERRIDE`, which refuses only when the change would
 * actually strand a dependent booking, and answers with the affected bookings and
 * nights so the confirmation dialog can state what is being overridden.
 *
 * WHY NOT JUST RECORD IT HONESTLY AS AN UNEXPLAINED SYSTEM CHANGE, which is what
 * this helper did first. Because it made §7's mandatory reason unreachable: no caller
 * supplied one, so `OFFICER_OVERRIDE`, `HostingCoverageIncident.overrideReason` and
 * `overriddenByMemberId` were dead outside tests, every officer change looked
 * identical to a cron sweep in the audit trail, and an officer removing the last
 * qualifying adult was given no indication that another booking was about to be
 * stranded. Asking is the only way the reason exists.
 *
 * THE ACTOR'S OWN IDENTITY IS PART OF THE ANSWER (§6, §11). `coverageActorMemberId`
 * travels with the disposition because `BLOCK` names the owner's OTHER bookings in
 * its refusal, and that is only safe to show the owner. See the ownership check in
 * `settleSameOwnerDependentCoverage`.

/**
 * Reconcile a booking AND the split siblings whose answer depends on it (#2364).
 *
 * THE ENTRY POINT EVERY MUTATION PATH USES. `loadSiblingHosts` lets a #738 split
 * child borrow its parent's adults, which makes the child's answer a function of
 * rows the child does not own: the member shortening their own stay on the
 * parent takes a host away from the child, and extending it gives one back,
 * without touching a single row on the child. Reconciling only the mutated id
 * would leave the other half of the pair asserting facts that are no longer
 * true — no review where the club now has unhosted guest-nights, and a stale
 * PENDING review where it no longer does.
 *
 * The fan-out is ONE LEVEL and that is exact, not a safety margin: the borrow
 * relation is direct-parent / direct-child of the same member, so expanding from
 * a sibling could only ever lead back to the booking just reconciled. Each
 * sibling is reconciled with DEFAULT options — an admin's on-behalf decision
 * belongs to the booking they were making, never to a row reached through it, so
 * a hazard that appears on a sibling always opens PENDING.
 *
 * Costs no extra SIBLING work while the rule is off: the mode reported by the
 * first reconciliation is the same one it evaluated under, so a club that has
 * not turned the policy on never fans out.
 *
 * AND IT NOW COSTS NO FENCE EITHER (#2623 T5). This used to acquire the
 * participant proof BEFORE reading the policy mode, so a club with hosting
 * disabled paid the `FOR KEY SHARE NOWAIT` statement and its two under-lock
 * re-reads on every booking write — and could still be refused with the fixed
 * `HOSTING_COVERAGE_PARTICIPANT_RETRY` 409 by a concurrent member-lifecycle
 * writer, for a rule it does not use. That 409 tells a member to reload and to
 * check their payment status, which at such a club is a scary, payment-flavoured
 * refusal produced entirely by a switched-off feature guarding a queue row that
 * would never be written.
 *
 * The mode is therefore read FIRST, as the sibling seam
 * `enqueueOwnHostingCoverageReevaluation` also does, and an inactive mode returns
 * through the plain single-booking reconciler — which is what the fenced path did
 * anyway once `outcome.mode` came back inactive, minus the lock. The single-id
 * reconciler still runs, because clearing a snapshot left behind by a lodge that
 * has since switched the rule off is exactly its job.
 *
 * THE THRESHOLD IS NOT THE SIBLING'S, and the difference is deliberate rather than
 * drift (#2623 F5). That seam gates on `resolved.mode !== "ENFORCED"`, because all
 * it does is enqueue queue work that only an ENFORCED lodge can ever act on. This
 * one gates on `hostingModeIsActive` — ENFORCED *or* ADMIN_REVIEW_REQUIRED —
 * because under review-only the dependants still have to be re-read and a review
 * snapshot still has to be written, so the fence is genuinely owed. Narrowing this
 * to the sibling's test skips the fence at a review-only lodge that needs it, and
 * the `ADMIN_REVIEW_REQUIRED` case in `adult-member-hosting-same-owner.test.ts`
 * fails if you try it.
 *
 * SKIPPING THE FENCE HERE IS SAFE, not merely cheap: with the mode inactive
 * `evaluateBookingAdultMemberHosting` takes no coverage-owner advisory key, so
 * there is no coverage-owner → Member ordering left to protect, and neither the
 * sibling fan-out nor `settleSameOwnerDependentCoverage` — the two things that
 * consume the proof — is reachable. A club that turns the rule ON between this
 * read and the reconciler's own read is covered the same way every other mode
 * gate in this module is: the policy write holds the policy-set key and enqueues
 * re-evaluation for the affected bookings itself.

 *  - the reconciliation that ran a moment ago CLEARED the review, so this booking's
 *    own facts no longer carry the hazard → `BOOKING_AMENDED`.

 * The fourth, `COVERAGE_RESTORED`, is not decided here on purpose: it is a fact
 * about ANOTHER booking supplying cover, which only the post-commit drain can
 * establish against committed rows.

 *
 * THE SCOPE IS THE HARD PRECONDITION; THE CONSEQUENCE DECIDES WHAT HAPPENS.
 *
 *  - the scope: without `SAME_BOOKING_OWNER` no booking's compliance can depend on
 *    another booking, so there is nothing to strand, nothing to escalate and
 *    nothing to re-read. This function returns immediately and a club that is not
 *    on the scope pays one cached policy read per booking write.
 *  - `ENFORCED`: the full behaviour below — refuse a member, ask an officer to
 *    confirm, escalate a system change to an urgent incident.
 *  - `ADMIN_REVIEW_REQUIRED`: never refuse and never open an incident — an
 *    uncovered booking is a normal, permitted state there and the pending review is
 *    already the officer's signal — but the dependents STILL have to be re-read.
 *    That is the one class of staleness this scope introduces which the review
 *    consequence cannot catch by itself: with `SAME_BOOKING` alone a booking's cover
 *    can only change through its own rows or its split siblings, and both are
 *    reconciled on every write, whereas under this scope a change to a DIFFERENT
 *    booking can strand it and nothing else will ever look. Returning early here
 *    left such a booking recorded as compliant indefinitely, which makes §1's
 *    "record and clearly surface the uncovered non-member nights for Booking
 *    Officer review" untrue for exactly the case the new scope adds. So the work is
 *    queued and the drain refreshes each dependent's own snapshot after commit;
 *    `reconcileSameOwnerCoverageIncident` opens no incident while the mode is not
 *    `ENFORCED`, so the officer's queue is not doubled.

 * can remove exact-night attendance already takes the per-lodge capacity lock". That
 * was false in both directions: `booking-cancel.ts`'s claim transactions take
 * `pg_advisory_xact_lock(1)` and never the lodge lock, while `booking-create.ts` and
 * the guest-add route take the lodge lock and never `lock(1)`. Those are different
 * keys at READ COMMITTED over disjoint rows, so a cancel removing the last
 * qualifying adult could interleave with a create that had just read that adult as
 * cover, and the outcome depended on commit order — the exact non-determinism §9
 * forbids. With the owner key held by both sides one of them always sees the other's
 * committed rows. This function reads through the caller's `tx`, so it sees that
 * transaction's own writes and the committed state of everything else.

 * exact uncovered nights — and the guest DELETE route deliberately admits a member
 * from a different account: `booking-guest-removal-service.ts` sets `isSelfRemoval`
 * for a member-linked guest taking their own row off, and the self-removable
 * statuses include CONFIRMED and PAID, exactly the ones that qualify as coverage
 * sources. So an adult member who is a guest on somebody else's booking could
 * remove themselves, be answered `BLOCK`, and be handed that owner's booking
 * reference, lodge and nights, in a sentence addressing them as though the booking
 * were on their own account.
 *
 * There is a second harm on the same path, and it is the reason the answer is
 * `ESCALATE` rather than a redacted refusal: every remedy §6's message offers —
 * amend the affected booking, restore alternative cover, ring an officer — belongs
 * to the OWNER. A guest refused here could not comply by any means available to
 * them; they would simply be pinned to a stranger's booking indefinitely. §8's
 * principle applies exactly: allow the change nobody can sensibly block, and record
 * the consequence durably instead. The owner is emailed, the incident is raised, the
 * officer queue shows it.
 *
 * DEFENCE IN DEPTH RATHER THAN TRUST IN THE CALL SITES. Every site does pass
 * `coverageActorMemberId`, and `adult-member-hosting-call-sites.test.ts` pins that.
 * This check is here as well because it is the last point before the disclosure, and
 * a site that forgot the field fails towards escalation — an allowed change plus an

 * course, which is correct — a confirmation adds attendance, and attendance can
 * RESTORE cover as easily as remove it.
 *

/**
 * Record the re-evaluation a change to ONE PERSON's standing implies (#2576 §8).
 *
 * THE MISSING HALF OF §8, AND IT WAS THE FIRST ITEM ON ITS LIST. "Membership
 * becoming inactive, lapsed, cancelled or archived" heads the changes that cannot
 * reasonably be blocked and must instead record durable re-evaluation work. Only the
 * evaluator half existed — a lapsed or unconsented adult correctly stops counting as
 * a host — while nothing told the club to go and look. So an officer deactivating a
 * membership, the Xero sync marking one lapsed, or an adult declining their
 * member-guest invite left a confirmed booking silently non-compliant: no incident,
 * no owner email, no officer-queue entry, and the booking's own review snapshot still
 * reading "compliant". There is no periodic sweep to compensate — the 3-hourly cron
 * drains queue rows and nothing else — so the obligation had to be recorded at the
 * moment the standing changed.
 *
 * It also removed a trap. `inspectSameOwnerDependents` classifies a hazard as
 * "newly uncovered" by comparing against the dependent's stored review snapshot and
 * its open incident. With neither written, the member's NEXT edit was blamed for the
 * lapse: they could no longer cancel or amend the booking that used to supply cover,
 * because the refusal told them to fix the other booking first, which they could not
 * do without a qualifying adult.
 *
 * WHAT IT ENQUEUES, AND WHY THAT IS STILL BOUNDED (§10). Attendance — not ownership
 * (§2) — is what a person's standing changes, so the fan-out is driven by this
 * member's own `BookingGuest` rows on live, current-or-future bookings. Each row
 * becomes ONE queue item naming that booking's OWNER, its lodge and its own nights:
 * exactly the owner/lodge/night triple every other item carries, so the drain cannot
 * widen it into the lodge-wide sweep #2575 rejected. Past stays are excluded because
 * a lapse cannot retroactively break a completed attendance record (§3).
 *
 * GATED ON `ENFORCED` AND NOT ON THE SCOPE, deliberately, and this is the one place
 * the two gates differ. Incidents exist only under `ENFORCED` — that rule is
 * unchanged — but a lapse removes cover under `SAME_BOOKING` just as surely as under
 * `SAME_BOOKING_OWNER`, and the drain reconciles each booking through the shared
 * evaluator, which honours whichever scopes the lodge actually has on. Gating on the
 * scope would have left an enforcing single-booking club with no lapse detection at
 * all, for no reason.
 *
 * THE PARTICIPANT FENCE IS ALREADY MODE-GATED HERE and always was: the per-lodge
 * `ENFORCED` filter below returns 0 before any proof is acquired, so #2623 T5's
 * report that this seam takes the participant lock ungated does not hold against
 * this code. The subject barrier ABOVE it is ungated, and deliberately — see the
 * comment at that lock.

 * Look at every same-owner booking this change could have touched, and report two

 *
 * "NEWLY" IS THE WHOLE SUBTLETY, and getting it wrong makes the rule unusable in
 * one direction and useless in the other. A booking that was ALREADY uncovered —
 * because an officer overrode something last week, or a membership lapsed and an
 * incident is open — must not block an unrelated edit the member makes today: they
 * cannot fix that booking by abandoning this change, so refusing would trap them.
 * A booking that is uncovered only BECAUSE of this change must block it.
 *
 * The test is the shared material-identity key (`adultMemberHostingStateKey`, the
 * same definition that decides whether an officer's review decision still applies
 * and whether the owner has already been notified): if the dependent's uncovered
 * state after this change is identical to what its own stored review snapshot or
 * its open incident already records, this change did not cause it. Anything else —
 * a first hazard, or a materially different one — is caused by this change.
 *
 * The SECOND list is what makes automatic resolution work. A dependent with an open
 * incident has to be re-examined after commit whether or not anything is stranded
 * now, because the change may have RESTORED its cover — §14's existential rule and
 * §7's automatic resolution both live on that read.
 *
 * READ-ONLY. It evaluates each dependent rather than reconciling it, on purpose:
 * under `BLOCK` the change is about to be rolled back by the throw, so writing
 * review rows for dependents would either be undone (harmless but pointless) or,
 * worse, would record a hazard derived from rows that never existed.
