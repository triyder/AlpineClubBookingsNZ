/**
 * Durable booking-lifecycle event store (issue #740).
 *
 * BookingEvent is a durable narrative fact store, not a complete transition
 * ledger. It captures the facts needed to render a plain-language narrative
 * later (amounts, dates, cancellation-policy snapshot, bump reason) for the
 * transitions that affect member/admin storytelling. Unlike AuditLog these rows
 * are never retention-pruned, so the narratives in `src/lib/booking-narrative.ts`
 * survive audit-log pruning.
 *
 * Status fields, AuditLog, CronJobRun, and provider/payment ledgers remain the
 * complete lifecycle evidence for transitions that do not need narrative facts
 * here, such as waitlist offers, admin review approval, force-confirm, and
 * scheduled completion.
 *
 * BookingEvent is additive: structured AuditLog writes for admin actions still
 * apply. This is a write helper only — it never throws into the caller's
 * transaction path; a failed event write is logged and swallowed so a booking
 * transition is never rolled back purely because its narrative event failed.
