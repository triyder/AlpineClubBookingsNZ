/**
 * Admin re-send of the "you still owe this" email (#2350).
 *
 * The automatic chase (src/lib/cron-additional-payment-reminders.ts) covers the
 * ordinary case; this is the officer on the phone who needs the member to have
 * the message in front of them now. It sends the SAME email the cron sends, so
 * an admin override of the wording applies to both.
 *
 * Four properties make it safe to give an admin a button that emails a member:
 *
 *  1. **It cannot fan out.** The stamp that suppresses the automatic reminder is
 *     also the cooldown record, and it is written by a guarded `updateMany`
 *     BEFORE the send. Two clicks in the same second leave one winner; the loser
 *     is told the message just went out.
 *  2. **Auto and manual share one clock, in both directions.** Because both
 *     write the same stamps, a cron reminder sent minutes ago blocks a re-send
 *     exactly as another re-send would — and a re-send suppresses whichever
 *     automatic nudge was coming, INCLUDING the last-chance one when that is the
 *     reminder currently due (it closes both stamps, as the cron's final branch
 *     does). Stamping only the day-N column left the guarantee one-directional.
 *  3. **Silence is honoured up front.** A booking with the "No emails" switch on
 *     is refused with an explanation rather than being handed to the mailer to
 *     withhold — the admin is standing right there, and a silent withhold looks
 *     identical to a successful send.
 *  4. **Only a send that actually went out reads as sent.** The mailer RETURNS
 *     rather than throws when it withholds (suppressed address, walk-in
 *     placeholder address, the switch flipping on after the check above), so the
 *     outcome is inspected: anything other than "sent" gives the stamps back and
 *     answers with what really happened. The single exception — an UNREADABLE
 *     switch — keeps the stamps because the mailer left a FAILED EmailLog row
 *     that the retry job replays; the reply says so rather than inviting a
 *     retry the cooldown would then refuse. Same rule, same exception, as the
 *     cron (src/lib/cron-additional-payment-reminders.ts).
