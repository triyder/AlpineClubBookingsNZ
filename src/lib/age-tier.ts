/**
 * THE SAME SETTINGS, WITHOUT THE FALLBACK — for evidence, not for product paths.
 *
 * `getAgeTierSettings` below swallows any database failure and returns
 * `AGE_TIER_DEFAULTS`. That is right for a product path: a booking screen with the
 * default tiers is better than a booking screen with an error, and the defaults are
 * the club's own documented starting point.
 *
 * IT IS WRONG FOR AN EVIDENCE PATH, and the failure is quiet in the worst way. AI
 * Diagnostics reports whether a member's tier owes a season subscription. On a cold
 * cache and a transient database failure, the swallow hands it the DEFAULT rule and
 * nothing marks the answer as unobserved — so a club that has configured its tiers
 * differently gets a confident, wrong, directly actionable finding
 * ("subscription_unpaid" against a member whose tier the club exempts), with an
 * observed-at timestamp that makes it look freshly measured. `#2376`'s result
 * contract has a state for exactly this (`evidence_unavailable`) and the owner's
 * decision requires missing evidence to be reported as missing.
 *
 * SO THE TWO CASES ARE SEPARATED, which is the whole point of this function:
 *
 *  - The read FAILED → this rejects, and the caller reports evidence unavailable.
 *  - The table is genuinely EMPTY → the club has configured no tiers, the platform's
 *    documented defaults are what actually govern it, and those are returned. That
 *    is an observation, not a fallback.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT TOUCH THE SHARED CACHE, in either direction. Not reading it keeps a
 * stale five-minute-old row from being reported as freshly observed; not writing it
 * keeps a diagnostics read from changing what every other request in the process
 * computes, which is the same rule that stops this pack reseeding the
 * financial-year cache.
