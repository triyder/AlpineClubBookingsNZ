/**
 * #4295: what it costs to join, as one figure per membership type and age tier:
 * the current joining fee plus the current annual fee, resolved as the invoicing
 * resolves them (`getEffectiveJoiningFee`, `getEffectiveMembershipAnnualFee`,
 * `membership-subscription-billing`). The figure is for ONE person: a flat
 * `PER_FAMILY` annual fee is added once, a `PER_MEMBER` one is not multiplied.
 *
 * - An exact-tier row wins, then the type's flat row. A type without age groups
 *   reads only its flat rows, as the invoicing does for its single tier.
 * - No subscription is added for a `NOT_REQUIRED` type, for a `NO_INVOICE` fee,
 *   or for a `BASED_ON_AGE_TIER` tier that is not subscription-liable when its
 *   fee is per member (a per-family fee still applies to it).
 * - A subscription that is required but has no annual fee leaves the row out:
 *   a joining fee alone would read as the whole first-year cost. No joining fee
 *   set means no joining fee.
 * - A prorated annual fee shows "up to", since a mid-season joiner pays less.
 * Needs BOTH the Joining fees and Annual membership fees opt-ins.
