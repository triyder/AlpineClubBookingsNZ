/**
 * Derive a human-readable alt fallback from an image src filename so an image
 * whose author omitted `alt` is still announced meaningfully by screen readers
 * (WCAG 1.1.1) instead of the browser reading out the raw `src`. Mirrors the
 * gallery directory-listing branch, which already uses the file name as alt.
 *
 * `data:` URIs carry no filename — returning "" for them avoids emitting a
 * massive base64 blob as alt text (#1947). Callers treat an empty return as
 * "no meaningful label available": the sanitiser backfills alt="" (explicit
 * decorative, silencing the src read-out) and the gallery render component
 * supplies a positional fallback because each gallery image is a link's only
 * content.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free (no server-only imports) so it can be shared by both
 * the HTML sanitiser (src/lib/page-content-html.ts) and the embed extractor
 * (src/lib/page-content-embeds.ts) without dragging either module's graph into
 * the other.
