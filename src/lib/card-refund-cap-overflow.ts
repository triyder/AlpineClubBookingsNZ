/**
 * #4159 review round 2 (F2, `INV-PAY-135`): A CARD REFUND THE CHARGE'S
 * REFUNDED TOTAL COULD NOT HOLD.
 *
 * `recordStripeRefundsAgainstTransaction` caps a charge's refunded total at the
 * charge. Cents it has to discard are refund money already counted another
 * way - most often a hand-back or "Paid another way" close recorded by hand on
 * the same charge, then a card refund made for the same money (a capacity
 * race's hand-back whose charge Stripe refunded after the completion read it).
 * The member may have been paid back twice - where money already went back
 * another way on the payment (`memberPaidAnotherWay`) - or the charge's records
 * simply drifted. The alert says which. The cap keeps
 * the ledger whole, so nothing else would ever show it: the officers are told,
 * once per charge and set of counted refunds (a replay of the same refunds
 * alerts nothing new, any new refund does),
 * through the payment recovery alert, after the refund's own commit - never
 * inside it. The alert's claim (`sendAdminAlertOnceEver`) and the email row are
 * the durable record; the error log stays beside them.
