/**
 * E11 (#1937) — additive, master-wins member profile merge.
 *
 * The whole operation runs in ONE interactive transaction guarded first by the
 * hosting policy-set lock, then — since #2595, because merge repairs future
 * shared-double bed placements it invalidates — every affected lodge capacity
 * key in sorted order (and deliberately NOT the global cohort `lock(1)`, whose
 * cost over a 120s merge is why the lodge set is derived from future
 * guest-nights instead), then the dual `member-lifecycle:{id}` advisory lock, so
 * the fixed lodge -> member order holds, and finally the two
 * `member-partner-link:{id}` keys — because merge both re-points partner links
 * and reads them to decide which future shared doubles to delete
 * (see docs/CONCURRENCY_AND_LOCKING.md).
 * The hosting drain takes the same sorted keys for its claimed owner and actor,
 * then refreshes the exact queue payload. For a queue row that already exists,
 * this handshake starts here, before any relation move. After the moves, one
 * sorted Member row-lock statement covers master, loser and the exact queue
 * owners, followed by a plan re-read and late queue-pointer sweeps. Policy and
 * config-transfer reconciliation cannot interleave because it shares the
 * policy-set lock.
 * It re-points every Member-referencing relation onto the master, additively
 * fills the master's blank scalar fields from the loser, removes any future
 * shared DOUBLE bed the merge left without a confirmed partnership behind it
 * (#2595, step 3b, alerted after commit), tidies the loser's
 * Xero links, writes one critical audit, and hard-deletes the loser. There are
 * NO Xero API calls anywhere in this module — the loser's Xero contact is left
 * for manual clean-up (surfaced as a preview warning).

 *
 * No such column can silently land in a move/resolve bucket: the completeness

 * classification (and a test asserts no documented snapshot column overlaps a
 * classified relation column).
 *
 * COVERAGE (#2243). This list used to be "illustrative, not exhaustive", which
 * meant a new FK-less member-id column could escape the relation walk AND this
 * list with nothing in CI to notice — `CalendarEvent.createdById` and
 * `CalendarEventSeries.createdById` did exactly that. It is now exhaustive for
 * the DETECTABLE class: every column `parseFkLessMemberIdColumns` finds (an
 * FK-less `String` scalar whose name is used elsewhere in the schema as a Member
 * FK column) must appear here, enforced by member-merge-dmmf.test.ts, which
 * fails on the next one.
 *
 * NOT EXHAUSTIVE FOR THE UNDETECTABLE CLASS, and deliberately says so. Columns
 * with BESPOKE names that appear nowhere in the schema as a Member FK column
 * (`MemberApplication.nominator1Id`, `RefundRequest.reviewedBy`,
 * `IntegrationCredential.updatedByUserId`, …) are invisible to the detector, so
 * the first block below is a best-effort hand-kept list that nothing in CI can
 * prove complete. Read a gap there as a documentation gap, never as evidence
 * that no such column exists: adding one is a review responsibility, and the
 * only mechanical backstop is that an FK-less column cannot land in a
 * move/resolve bucket by accident (the completeness test above).
 *
 * Layout: the FIRST block is that hand-kept remainder (bespoke names plus the
 * entries that predate the detector); the SECOND is the detectable set.

 * #2243 — the FK-less member-id scalar columns a schema scan can actually FIND,
 * as sorted `Model.column` keys.
 *
 * The relation walk above is exact but structurally blind to columns that carry
 * no `@relation`: `CalendarEvent.createdById` and `CalendarEventSeries.createdById`
 * hold a Member id in a bare `String` and escaped both the walk and the
 * documented snapshot list entirely, so nothing in CI would have noticed the
 * next one either. This closes that by naming the detectable class mechanically
 * instead of by hand.
 *
 * The rule: a `String`/`String?` scalar that owns NO relation on its own model,
 * whose column NAME is used somewhere else in the schema as a Member FK column
 * (`memberId`, `createdById`, `updatedByMemberId`, ...). The repo names actor
 * columns consistently, so a new FK-less member-id column almost always reuses
 * one of those names and is caught. It is a DETECTOR, not a decision: everything
 * it returns must appear in `MEMBER_MERGE_SNAPSHOT_SCALAR_COLUMNS`, which is
 * where the "keep the loser's id as immutable history" classification is
 * recorded (the test in member-merge-dmmf.test.ts enforces that).
 *
 * It is deliberately a SUBSET of the FK-less member-id universe: bespoke names
 * that appear nowhere as a Member FK column (`MemberApplication.nominator1Id`,
 * `IssueReport.resolvedById`, `FamilyGroupJoinRequest.reviewedBy`, ...) are
 * invisible to it and stay hand-documented in that list. Deriving membership
 * from a name is the only signal the schema offers for a bare column, so a
 * detector that is right about a large, self-maintaining slice beats a promise
 * of exhaustiveness nothing can enforce.
 *
 * The name rule can in principle over-reach — a future `String` column called
 * `memberId` that holds someone ELSE's member number, say. Nothing in the schema
 * today does, and the remedy when one appears is to document it here with a note
 * saying why it is not a member id, not to loosen the detector: a false positive
 * costs one line, a false negative is the bug this exists to prevent.
 *
 * KNOWN PARSE ASSUMPTIONS (all true of `prisma/schema.prisma` today; re-check
 * them if the schema's shape ever changes):
 *   * ONE FIELD PER LINE, and `@relation(...)` entirely on that line. A
 *     multi-line `@relation` attribute would not be parsed, and its FK column
 *     would be mistaken for a bare scalar (a false POSITIVE, which costs one
 *     documented line, not a silent miss). No relation in this schema wraps, and
 *     `prisma format` does not wrap attributes — but we hand-edit the schema
 *     (AGENTS.md), so this is an assumption rather than a guarantee.
 *   * `//` COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED before matching, outside quoted strings.
 *     Without that a trailing comment such as
 *     `memberId String // was: @relation(fields: [memberId], ...)` registers a
 *     PHANTOM FK and hides the column from the detector entirely — a false
 *     negative, exactly the failure mode this exists to prevent.
 *   * `String[]` COLUMNS ARE EXCLUDED. The live instance is
 *     `HiddenFamilySuggestion.memberIds`, an array of member ids identifying a
 *     dismissed family suggestion. The merge does not rewrite it, so a
 *     merged-away loser's id stays in the array; the signature it was hidden
 *     under no longer matches the surviving membership, so a hidden suggestion
 *     can reappear for an admin to dismiss again. That is cosmetic and
 *     deliberate — array rewriting is a separate decision — but it is a real
 *     consequence, not an oversight.
 *   * `view` AND `type` BLOCKS ARE SKIPPED (only `model` opens a scan). There
 *     are none in this schema today; a member-id column added inside one would
 *     be invisible here.

/**
 * #2437 — the family links on which the under-lock state disagrees with the
 * transaction-opening snapshot the merge plan was built from.
 *
 * The four self-relation columns are written by admin paths that take no
 * `member-lifecycle` advisory lock (`admin-members-service.ts` and the
 * dependents link route), so a link can land between the merge's opening
 * snapshot and its writes. #2445 already stopped the CORRUPTION arm of that
 * race — `applyMoves` excludes the master's own row, so the master can never
 * become its own parent. What remained was SILENT LOSS: a link pointing at the
 * duplicate that lands mid-merge survives the moves un-repointed, and the
 * duplicate's hard-delete then nulls it via `onDelete: SetNull` — no error, no
 * warning, no audit entry; the admin's just-saved link is simply gone. This
 * differ detects every such interleaving from the fresh under-lock read so the
 * merge can refuse with the same 409 the field-patch drift check uses (owner
 * decision 1 Aug 2026: detect and refuse; deliberately NOT a new advisory-lock
 * participant and NOT a DB CHECK constraint).
 *
 * "Unchanged" is measured against what the merge ITSELF has done to these
 * columns by the time of the fresh read, not against the raw snapshot:
 *
 *  - MASTER row: step 1 (`nullSelfRelationCycles`) nulls a snapshot value equal
 *    to the loser id, and `applyMoves` excludes the master's row, so the
 *    expected value is the snapshot's with that one transform applied. Step 1
 *    is VALUE-CONDITIONAL and 409s itself when the pointer moved under it, and
 *    a successful null holds the master's row lock to commit — that pairing is
 *    what makes the `null` expectation here enforceable rather than a
 *    tautology over step 1's own write (the differ still fails closed on a
 *    surviving pointer as defense-in-depth). The live master-arm detections at
 *    this step are therefore the columns step 1 did NOT touch.
 *  - DUPLICATE row: step 3 (`applyMoves`) re-points captured non-master rows
 *    whose column equals the loser id — including, degenerately, the
 *    duplicate's own.
 *  - INBOUND rows: after step 3 no OTHER row may still reference the loser in
 *    any of the four columns; one that does was written after the token
 *    re-derivation captured that column's rows (the moves are id-bounded to
 *    that capture, so a later row is deliberately NOT swept) and would be
 *    silently nulled by the hard-delete — or, had it been swept, silently
 *    absorbed onto the master without the family-graph guards ever seeing it.
 *
 * Values are normalised with `?? null` so an absent column (a narrower select,
 * a mock row) compares like a null one.

 * #2255: merge is a parent-link WRITER, and until now an ungated one.
 *
 * It never creates a link by hand, which is exactly why it slipped past the

 * `secondaryParentId` from the loser onto the master, and the master keeps its
 * own outbound links. Collapsing two nodes into one therefore JOINS their
 * family chains, and two things the link-time cap forbids become reachable:
 *
 *  - DEPTH. Master four generations deep with nobody below, loser heading three
 *    generations of its own — neither breaches the cap alone, and the merged
 *    node spans six generations.
 *  - CYCLES. If master and loser are already related by parentage in either
 *    direction, the merged node becomes its own ancestor. `nullSelfRelationCycles`
 *    does not catch this: it only nulls MASTER columns whose value equals the
 *    loser id, so a loop closed through a third member (master → X, X → loser;
 *    merge loser into master and X's parent becomes master, which X is already
 *    the child of) survives it intact.
 *
 * Refusing is the right answer rather than repairing: which link to drop is a
 * statement about who is responsible for whom, and that is the admin's to make.
 *
 * The post-merge shape is simulated from the two members' own chains rather
 * than by re-implementing the mover, so the check cannot drift out of step with
 * it by being subtly more permissive. On the DESCENDANT side that simulation is
 * exact — inbound links move, so the merged node really does carry the deeper
 * of the two subtrees. On the ANCESTOR side it deliberately OVER-counts: the
 * loser's own parent columns die with the hard-deleted row, so the merged node
 * actually keeps only the MASTER's ancestors, and taking the max of the two can
 * refuse a merge that would in fact have fitted. That is the direction to err
 * in — it fails closed, and the refusal is actionable (unlink one of them
 * first), whereas an under-count would silently create the fifth generation the
 * whole cap exists to prevent.

    // (docs/CONCURRENCY_AND_LOCKING.md -> "The two-tier protocol"). Merge's own
    // lock set is member-scoped and took no lodge key before this change, so
    // reaching for the lodge tier down at the sweep — with both
    // `member-lifecycle:` keys already held — would acquire a lodge key AFTER a
    // member key and invert that order against every ordinary bed-allocation
    // writer, which takes global -> lodge and only then reaches a member tier.
    // Two such writers would then hold each other's next key: a deadlock, not a
    // style point.
    //
    // What merge deliberately does NOT take is the global cohort `lock(1)` that
    // the #1756 partner-share callers take (account-deletion approval, link
    // dissolve, deactivation, seasonal reassignment). An advisory xact lock is
    // released only at COMMIT and merge runs on a 120s budget, so holding the
    // global key for a whole merge excludes every cancel/capture/settle/refund
    // and every bed-allocation writer in the club — on their own default 5s
    // budgets, which means REJECTED with `P2028`, not merely queued. Merge is the
    // only partner-share caller long enough for that to matter, so it takes the
    // narrow lodge-only prefix and pays for it with a WIDER lodge derivation:
    // `acquireMemberMergePartnerSharedLodgeLocks` unions the lodges of the two
    // members' future allocations with the lodges of every booking they hold a
    // GUEST ROW on, so a lodge is covered even where no allocation exists there
    // yet. See docs/CONCURRENCY_AND_LOCKING.md -> "Merge joins the
    // bed-allocation cohort" for the deadlock analysis of the resulting edges.
    //
    // THAT SECOND READ CARRIES NO DATE FILTER, and #2672 is why. It used to ask
    // for FUTURE guest-nights only, which meant it filtered on
    // `BookingGuest.stayStart`/`stayEnd` and `BookingGuestNight` — all MUTABLE,
    // all rewritten by writers (the admin date override, and the in-progress
    // check-out extension that needs no override and no admin role) that hold
    // lock(1) plus their own lodge key and no member key merge holds. A lodge
    // with only PAST guest-nights at derivation time could therefore acquire
    // future ones mid-merge, in a lodge merge held no key for. Locking on the
    // guest row itself instead removes the class: no date write can make a
    // guest row stop being a guest row at that lodge.
    //
    // The one thing the derivation alone cannot promise is that its set does
    // not GROW, so step 3b re-derives it under the `Member … FOR UPDATE` taken
    // below — the point after which no INSERT or re-point of a `BookingGuest`
    // naming these members can commit, because that FK write needs
    // `FOR KEY SHARE` on the member row — and 409s if a lodge appeared. That
    // pair is what turns the argument into a fence rather than an observation.
    //
    // Deriving the lodge set here also needs BOTH identities: the helper reads
    // the two members' own future allocations and guest-nights, so it must run
    // while the loser's guest rows still name the loser.

    //   * LOSER — its row lock has been held since `teardownLoserXero` (step 4),
    //     which ends in an unconditional `member.update` on the loser.
    //   * MASTER — locked together with loser and every hosting queue owner by
    //     #2597's single sorted `FOR UPDATE` statement above. Without that lock a
    //     concurrent on-behalf upload FOR THE MASTER can commit a new blob M2
    //     between this read and the update; the merge would then overwrite the
    //     master's pointer with the loser's absorbed value and nothing would
    //     ever sweep M2 (`reconcileLoserMemberPhotos` only sweeps the LOSER's
    //     blobs), leaving an orphaned public asset. It would also produce
    //     avoidable drift refusals below. Both ids are locked in one id-ordered
    //     statement, matching the advisory locks at the top of the transaction,
    //     so this can never deadlock against the mirror merge.
    //     A stale MASTER is not harmless, which is why it is locked rather than
    //     merely re-read: its values decide whether a blank is filled from the
    //     loser AND which of two dates is earlier (`joinedDate` and
    //     `hutLeaderEligibleAt` are `Math.min` against the master's own value),
    //     so a stale master can change what is written, not just what is kept.
    //
    // What a row lock does NOT close: it protects these two `Member` ROWS, not
    // the rows their FKs POINT AT. A concurrent `FamilyGroup` delete (club
    // admin, `DELETE /api/admin/family-groups/[id]` behind `requireAdmin`) still
    // takes no member-lifecycle lock, so it can still abort the merge — now by
    // deadlocking against this lock (Postgres 40P01) rather than by writing a
    // stale value (23503). Genuinely closing that is out of scope here.
