 * `effectivePriceCents = finalPriceCents − appliedCredit <= 0` — with the
 * member's credit over-consumed. Refund the over-consumed slice back to the
 * member and clamp the net applied credit to the new price. Money integer cents.
 *
 * The refund is an append-only positive `BOOKING_APPLIED` offset row against the
 * same booking, so `deriveBookingAppliedCreditCents` nets to exactly
 * `newFinalPriceCents` and `getMemberCreditBalance` regains the excess. Because
 * the clamp only fires when `applied > newFinalPriceCents`, it always lands the
 * booking fully credit-covered (effective price 0); the caller then advances it
 * to PAID through the shared zero-dollar path.
 *
 * Must run inside the caller's transaction; takes the member-credit ledger lock
 * so it cannot interleave with `applyCreditToBooking` or restores. Idempotent
 * under transaction re-drive: a re-run re-derives the now-clamped applied total,
 * finds no excess, and writes nothing.
 *
 * Returns the post-clamp applied credit (what the effective-price and $0 auto-pay
 * decisions must use) and the excess refunded on THIS call.
 *
 * F3 (#1887) — KNOWN, BOUNDED Xero residual on Internet-Banking bookings (owner
 * decision to leave un-reversed; Xero territory). An unpaid IB booking allocates
 * its applied credit to the Xero invoice as ACCRECCREDIT notes at booking-create
 * (booking-create.ts, via enqueueXeroAppliedCreditAllocationOperation), unlike a
 * card booking whose allocation waits for cash capture and is skipped for IB in
 * xero-booking-invoices. When this clamp returns the excess to the LOCAL ledger
 * on a pre-payment IB reprice, that Xero allocation is NOT re-derived, so the
 * invoice keeps up to `refundedExcessCents` MORE credit allocated than the local
 * ledger now shows. The residual is strictly one-directional and bounded by the
 * refunded excess: the member is never under-credited locally (balance is
 * conserved), and the IB invoice only ever appears fully- or over-covered, never
 * underpaid, so no member is over-charged and no invoice is stranded outstanding.
 * The daily credit reconciliation (`cron-credit-reconciliation.ts`) checks LOCAL
 * consistency only (negative balances + orphaned applied credit) and does not
 * compare per-invoice Xero allocation to the local applied total, so it tolerates
 * this residual without false alerts. This matches the documented #1620 IB Xero
 * divergences (operator-reconciled). Reversing the Xero allocation would need an
 * out-of-transaction Xero call (no provider calls under this lock — F7/#1355) and
 * is left as an owner decision; see docs/DOMAIN_INVARIANTS.md.

 * that does more work after the restore. Returning 0 (not the existing amount) is
 * the correct no-op: it keeps the orphaned-applied-credit backfill's
 * `restoredCents <= 0 => did not heal` contract honest and avoids double
 * notifications. This is ledger-level dedupe, not a claim-first status layer —
 * the callers' status-guard already single-flights the path, so a second claim
