 * Promote the surviving second occupant to primary on each bed-night that just

 * another bed, or a cross-booking lifecycle prune (#1750). Without this, a lone
 * `isSecondOccupant=true` row is a safe dead-end (visible, no constraint
 * violation) but the orphan guard in `resolveSecondOccupant` blocks every new
 * placement on that bed-night until it is manually removed.
 *
 * The gate is `isSecondOccupant` only, NEVER the denormalized `bedType` of the
 * removed primary OR the survivor: AUTO-created rows carry the default SINGLE
 * even on a real DOUBLE (#1749), so trusting that type would skip the promotion
 * the partner needs — the exact failure #1749's "never trust denormalized
 * bedType" fix targeted, here in the REPAIR mechanism where declining silently
 * dead-ends the bed-night behind the orphan guard forever. A second-occupant row
 * can only exist on a genuine shared DOUBLE (`resolveSecondOccupant` checks the
 * live bed + the partial index enforces it), so the `isSecondOccupant=true`
 * lookup finds nothing on any other bed and nothing is written. The JS re-check
 * of `partner.isSecondOccupant` (the WHERE clause is the real gate) keeps a test
 * mock — whose `findFirst` ignores the WHERE — from fabricating a promotion.
 *
 * Runs on the supplied client so the caller's transaction wraps delete/move +
 * flip atomically. The removed primary must already be gone, so the flip to
 * `isSecondOccupant=false` cannot collide with
 * `@@unique([bedId, stayDate, isSecondOccupant])`. Returns the promoted rows so
 * the caller can audit them — a promoted partner may belong to a DIFFERENT
 * booking than the row that was removed.
