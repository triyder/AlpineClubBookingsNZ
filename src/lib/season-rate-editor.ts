/**
 * Build the POST /api/admin/seasons body that clones one lodge's season onto

 *
 * Two things this pins down, both of which were live bugs or near-bugs:
 *
 * 1. The rates go out under `membershipTypeRates`, NOT the legacy `rates` key.
 *    `seasonSchema` in the POST route requires `membershipTypeRates`, so the
 *    old `rates` body failed validation and every copy silently 400'd (#2129).
 * 2. `membershipTypeId` is carried across unchanged. `MembershipType` has no
 *    lodge scoping, so type ids are global and remain valid at the target lodge.
 *
 * Known rough edge (deliberate, fails loudly): a source season carrying a rate
 * row with `ageTier: "NOT_APPLICABLE"` copies as a hard 400. The column
 * `MembershipTypeSeasonRate.ageTier` is the full `AgeTier` enum and so permits
 * `NOT_APPLICABLE`, but `bookableAgeTierEnum` (`age-tier-schema.ts:22-28`)
 * deliberately excludes it — per-tier season rates are always people with an
 * age. Such a row cannot be created through the admin editor, so it should only
 * exist via direct SQL. The wizard collects the rejection into its `failed[]`
 * list and shows it, so this surfaces as a named per-season failure rather than
 * a silent skip — a rough edge, not a defect.
