/**
 * #1992 (Option 1) — best-effort Stripe-side cancellation of any in-flight
 * /pay link PaymentIntent the auto-charge claim just superseded, closing the
 * residual #1967 double-charge window: a link intent minted (client secret
 * already in the member's browser) BEFORE the claim revoked the booking's
 * links can otherwise still be confirmed after the saved card is charged.
 *
 * Ordering — runs AFTER the claim transaction commits (Stripe calls never run
 * inside a database transaction) and BEFORE the saved-card charge:
 *   - The claim revoked the booking's links under the lodge lock and the /pay
 *     intent path re-reads the link under that same lock (#1967 FIX-6), so no
 *     NEW link-intent mint can START after the claim. That does NOT freeze the
 *     swept set at claim time: a mint that passed the link re-read just before
 *     the claim records its PaymentTransaction row only after its Stripe
 *     round-trip, outside the lodge lock, so the row can land after this
 *     sweep's findMany and be missed entirely. The sweep is best-effort
 *     narrowing of the window, nothing more; Option 2 (the #1992
 *     duplicate-capture auto-refund below) is the authoritative backstop and
 *     must never be removed as "redundant".
 *   - Cancelling before the charge minimises the window in which the member's
 *     browser can still capture. A cancel that LOSES that race (the intent
 *     already succeeded → not cancellable, or the cancel API errors against a
 *     parallel confirm) is expected: the charge proceeds and the succeeded
 *     link intent's webhook lands on the then-PAID booking, where the #1992
 *     duplicate-capture auto-refund in markBookingPaymentSucceeded is the
 *     backstop for whichever capture arrives second.
 *   - The sweep EXCLUDES every transaction minted under the shared
 *     `pending_charge_<bookingId>` Stripe idempotency key (matched by reason:
 *     PENDING_HOLD_AUTO_CHARGE_REASON for this cron's own prior-run charge,
 *     PENDING_SAVED_METHOD_CHARGE_REASON for charge-saved-method's
 *     3DS-pending charge): Stripe re-returns that key's intent when this run
 *     charges, so cancelling either row would cancel this run's own charge —
 *     the idempotent replay would come back as the cancelled intent and the
 *     settlement would stall until the key expires.
 *
 * Deliberately Stripe-side only and best-effort (no durable
 * CANCEL_PAYMENT_INTENT recovery operation): the durable cancel path's
 * succeeded-intent handoff mints its own superseded-payment refund, which
 * would race the #1992 duplicate-capture refund for the same money under
 * different Stripe keys. Losing a transient cancel here only re-opens the
 * window Option 2 already covers. Local ledger state is left to the
 * payment_intent.canceled webhook, as with every other cancelled intent.
