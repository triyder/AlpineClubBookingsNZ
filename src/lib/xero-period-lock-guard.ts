/**
 * Xero period lock-date guard (#1695 create, #1697 admin override modify,
 * #1729 ordinary date edits).
 *
 * A booking's PRIMARY Xero invoice is issue-dated at the booking's check-in
 * (getBookingInvoiceIssueDate) — on create, and again when a date edit queues
 * the invoice date/narration update (unpaid bookings) or a zero-dollar
 * recalculate creates the missing invoice. Such a write into a period locked
 * in Xero strands the outbox operation until the period is unlocked, so this
 * module rejects the triggering edit up front with an actionable message.
 *
 * Two guard scopes, deliberately asymmetric (owner decisions on #1718/#1729):
 * - The ADMIN OVERRIDE modify paths keep the CONSERVATIVE guard: every
 *   recalculate override is checked, even when the settlement would only
 *   write today-dated documents (supplementary invoices and modification
 *   credit notes are dated at the day they are raised, not at check-in) —
 *   original decision on #1697, re-affirmed and settled on #1718.
 * - ORDINARY (non-override) date edits get the NARROW guard (#1729): it fires
 *   only when the edit would actually queue the check-in-dated invoice
 *   update — issued Xero invoice, dates changing, payment not settled — via
 *   the same predicate queueXeroBookingEditSettlement classifies with
 *   (wouldQueueCheckInDatedInvoiceUpdate). Most member edits are on paid
 *   bookings; blocking those would be pure false alarm. Identity-only edits
 *   (guest name fixes) are never guarded — the outbox backstop covers that
 *   rare strand rather than blocking a typo fix.
 *
 * Semantics (shared by create and both modify scopes):
 * - Only PAST check-ins are guarded — the retroactive paths are the ones that
 *   can land documents in a closed period.
 * - Skipped when the Xero module is disabled or Xero is not connected.
 * - Fails closed when the lock dates cannot be read: the caller returns a
 *   retryable 503 rather than silently skipping the guard.
 * - Must be called OUTSIDE any DB transaction (it performs a Xero API call).
 * - Error text is actor-appropriate (#1729): admins get Xero unlock
 *   instructions, members get a "contact an administrator" message — same
 *   codes and statuses for both audiences.
