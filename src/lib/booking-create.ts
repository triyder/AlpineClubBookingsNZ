/**
 * Booking creation service.
 *
 * The POST /api/bookings route handler used to mix request parsing,
 * auth gates, capacity locking, pricing, promo/credit, persistence,
 * payment-flow decisions, audit, and Xero queueing in one file. This
 * service owns the business orchestration: it takes already-validated
 * inputs (member resolved, dates parsed, guests normalized), runs the
 * appropriate transaction, and returns either a created booking or a
 * structured outcome the route handler turns into an HTTP response.
 *
 * Conventions preserved:
 *   - money values stay integer cents
 *   - booking dates stay NZ date-only (Date with time set to 00:00)
 *   - external network calls (email, Xero) stay outside long DB
 *     transactions (fired-and-forget after commit)
 *   - booking creation transactions serialise per lodge via
 *     acquireLodgeCapacityLock so capacity checks stay safe without
 *     cross-lodge contention
