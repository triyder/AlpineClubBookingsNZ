 * two hand-kept copies is exactly the drift `composeOptionalEmailLine` and
 * `appliedCreditSummaryRows` exist to prevent, so the paragraph moved here.
 *
 * TWO SHAPES, chosen by whether `accountCredit` is supplied.
 *
 * 1. NO APPLICABLE CREDIT (`accountCredit` absent) — the #2444 paragraph,
 *    unchanged to the byte. This is what every member on today's one live
 *    unpaid path receives. The "Total Due" line above is the BOOKING's own
 *    price; the invoice the member actually pays against is a separate document
 *    a club admin can adjust by hand in Xero, so the closing sentence points at
 *    the invoice as the figure to transfer and names the commonest reason the
 *    two would differ. It is CONDITIONAL and states no second figure, because
 *    most invoices match the total exactly, and it does NOT say credit "will be
 *    applied", because on this path nothing applies it: the member whole-lodge
 *    approval in `school-booking-request.ts` mints a brand-new booking and
 *    writes no `MemberCredit` row, so the
 *    `enqueueXeroAppliedCreditAllocationOperation` call it makes always
 *    short-circuits with "No unallocated applied credit; nothing to allocate."
 *    (re-verified in review, 1 Aug 2026 — an earlier draft asserted the
 *    opposite and was corrected before merge; do not reinstate it without
 *    making the allocation real).
 *
 * 2. CREDIT APPLIED TO THIS BOOKING (`accountCredit` supplied, #2483). The
 *    caller supplies it only from `resolveUnpaidCreditNetting`, and its
 *    `outcome` picks one of three further shapes — because the one thing this
 *    paragraph must never do is name a figure the club's own ledger
 *    contradicts:
 *
 *    - `"netted"` (credit smaller than the price) — names the NET figure, shows
 *      the arithmetic in words, and asks for it.
 *    - `"covered"` (credit equals the price exactly) — asks for NOTHING. This
 *      is not a corrupt state: it is the documented steady state of the #1887
 *      reprice clamp, and it is exactly what the club's own amount-owing law
 *      calls "nothing owing" (`prepareManualSettlement` refuses to take a
 *      payment for it). Asking for the price here would be a 100% overpayment
 *      — the single worst outcome this whole change exists to prevent — so the
 *      paragraph states that nothing further is to be transferred.
 *    - `"unreconciled"` (more credit applied than the booking costs) — names NO
 *      figure and issues NO payment instruction at all. Something upstream is
 *      inconsistent, and a refusal that still printed the gross price and told
 *      the member to pay it would be the same overpayment wearing a disclaimer.
 *      The member is asked to wait; the sender logs it for an admin.
 *
 *    Why the closing instruction inverts under `"netted"`. Under (1) the email
 *    defers to the invoice. It cannot do that here: the allocation that reduces
 *    the invoice is processed asynchronously on the Xero outbox, so a member
 *    reading the invoice first may still see the full price — and "transfer
 *    what the invoice shows" would then produce exactly the overpayment this
 *    whole change exists to prevent. So the netted figure stands where the
 *    invoice asks for MORE.
 *
 *    It is deliberately NOT symmetric (#2483 review, 2 Aug 2026). An invoice
 *    asking for LESS than the netted figure is the drift direction a hand edit
 *    in Xero produces, and telling the member to transfer the email's larger
 *    figure anyway would recreate the very overpayment #2444 was raised to
 *    stop. So the rule is "pay the smaller of the two, and tell the club":
 *    underpaying is recoverable by an admin, overpaying is not, and either way
 *    the disagreement is routed to the club rather than acted on silently.
 *    Admins are not left to notice it by hand: a separate reconciliation
 *    checker (#2501) compares the club's credits against Xero's and warns them
 *    on drift. The sentence promises only that the club will check — never that
 *    Xero has already been updated, which this module cannot know.
 *
 * `amount`, `reference` and the `accountCredit` figures arrive ALREADY
 * FORMATTED and already escaped for the caller's medium — this module imports
 * nothing (see the file docblock), so money formatting stays with the caller,
 * and the HTML path escapes the club-entered reference at its own edge exactly
 * as it did before. `amount` and `reference` are UNUSED under `"covered"` and
 * `"unreconciled"`: neither shape may ask for money, so neither may quote a
 * figure or a payment reference.

 * #2621 (epic #2629, owner decision D-M5) — the checkout-day chore sentence of
 * the pre-arrival reminder, shared by the hand-built HTML

 * admin-editable body renders.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR. Under the midday-to-midday guest night (#2622/#2631) a guest
 * is present on their checkout morning and is therefore eligible for that
 * morning's chore. Nobody is asked for a departure time and none is inferred:
 * a member who wants to leave early talks to the hut leader. This sentence is
 * where the pre-arrival reminder says so, in the owner's own words.
 *
 * WHY IT IS COMPOSED RATHER THAN WRITTEN INTO THE DEFAULT BODY. **The chores
 * module defaults OFF** (`ClubModuleSettings.chores` is `@default(false)`), and
 * plenty of clubs never turn it on. An unconditional sentence in the shipped
 * default would tell every member of every one of those clubs that they are on a
 * chore roster that does not exist, and instruct them to talk to a hut leader
 * about it — on the last message most members read before they travel. This is
 * the `{{choreListNote}}` shape from the sibling `checkin-reminder` template in
 * the same file: the sender composes the whole sentence or nothing at all, and
 * the flat body carries only the token, because `renderTemplateString` has no
 * conditional syntax to express "only when the club runs a chore roster".
 *
 * Empty is the ORDINARY case, not the exceptional one, so the token is declared
 * in `OPTIONAL_TEMPLATE_TOKENS["pre-arrival-reminder"]` — it is in the shipped
 * default body, which is what makes that the correct table rather than
 * `EMPTYABLE_OVERRIDE_TOKENS` — and guard 4 proves the default body renders
 * cleanly without it.
 *
 * THE SEPARATOR RIDES THE VALUE, NOT THE BODY. This function returns the bare
 * sentence; the SENDER wraps it with `composeOptionalEmailLine(null, …,
 * { trailing: "\n\n" })` for the flat token, and the HTML template puts the same
 * bare sentence in its own `<p>`. So the default body carries
 * `{{checkoutChoreNote}}{{outstandingAdditionalNote}}` with no newlines of its
 * own around the token — the `{{adminNoteLine}}` / `{{promoSummary}}`
 * convention. Newlines in the BODY would be emitted for every club whether or
 * not it runs chores, which would change the shape of the reminder that
 * chore-free clubs (the default) receive, for a sentence they never get. As
 * written, a chores-OFF send is byte-identical to the pre-#2621 message and a
 * chores-ON send gets a paragraph of its own in both the flat body and the HTML.
 *
 * The wording is the owner's, verbatim, and may not be paraphrased here.

 *
 * The bumped notice used to end in "Book Again: {BASE_URL}/book" for everyone,
 * but `/book` is the MEMBER booking flow behind the login. Two of the three
 * recipient classes that reach `sendBookingBumpedEmail` cannot use it:
 *
 *   - a club MEMBER whose pending booking (their own non-member guests, or a
 *     split guest child) lost its beds — `/book` is exactly right;
 *   - the non-login NON_MEMBER/SCHOOL contact who owns a booking converted from
 *     a public booking request (#707), and any other non-login contact an admin
 *     booked on behalf of — these have `canLogin = false` by construction
 *     (`assertMappableOwnerContact` refuses a login-capable owner outright), so
 *     `/book` bounces them to a login they can never complete.
 *
 * There is no tokenised respond link to offer them either: the bump path
 * revokes the booking's payment links, and the request itself is CONVERTED, so
 * the club's contact page is the only live way back in.
 *
 * Whichever way it goes, the notice also names the club's support address (the
 * `{{SUPPORT_EMAIL}}` line both the HTML template and the default body carry),
 * because a club-authored Contact page need not host a contact form — without
 * that line a recipient who cannot sign in could be left with no way to reply
 * at all. Both branches carry it, so the two readers get the same courtesy.
 *
 * Shared by the hand-built HTML template and the `{{rebookLabel}}` /
 * `{{rebookPath}}` tokens the admin-editable body renders, so the two paths
 * cannot drift. The caller owns the base URL — this module deliberately
 * imports nothing.
