/**
 * Public non-member booking request flow (issue #707).
 *
 * Lifecycle: NEW -> (email verification) -> VERIFIED -> (officer pricing)
 * -> PRICED -> (officer decision) -> APPROVED/DECLINED -> CONVERTED.
 *
 * Approval converts the request into a non-login Member (canLogin: false)
 * plus a PENDING Booking owned by it, mirroring the membership application
 * pattern in src/lib/nomination.ts. Booking.memberId stays required.
 *
 * Conventions:
 *   - money stays integer cents
 *   - booking dates stay NZ date-only values
 *   - only SHA-256 token hashes are stored (issueActionToken)
 *   - external calls (email) run after the transaction commits

  //   * accept-wins-first — the requester accept converts the held booking to a
  //     live PENDING booking before this decline runs; `requireRequestHold: true`

  //     than clobber it, so decline never destroys a paid booking.
  //   * decline-wins-first — this decline claims DECLINED and releases the hold
  //     first; the concurrent accept's status-guarded re-arm
  //     (booking-request-quotes.ts, notIn [DECLINED, CANCELLED]) then refuses to
  //     resurrect the finalised request, so no new booking is ever created.
  // Because the hold-release runs only after the request is claimed DECLINED,
  // `cancelBooking` here can only ever act on a still-held AWAITING_REVIEW
  // booking, never a booking a winning accept already converted. Releasing
  // reuses the shared `cancelBooking` path (mirroring the admin "Release hold"
  // route): it cancels the held booking, reconciles/frees the beds, detaches
  // `heldBookingId`, and audits. It self-locks on advisory key 1 and runs its
