// One-off, idempotent, local-only backfill for account credit that a member
// applied to a booking (a negative BOOKING_APPLIED MemberCredit row) but which
// was never reversed when the booking was cancelled — the pre-#1547 defect:
// applying credit, abandoning payment, then cancelling left the negative row on
// the ledger, so the member permanently lost that credit (#1547).
//
// Detection (per CANCELLED booking, conservative — never over-restores):
//   status === CANCELLED
//     ∧ ∃ MemberCredit(type=BOOKING_APPLIED, appliedToBookingId=booking)
//     ∧ ¬∃ MemberCredit(type=CANCELLATION_REFUND, sourceBookingId=booking)
//     ∧ (no payment ∨ (¬paymentHasCaptureEvidence(payment)
//                       ∧ payment.status ≠ SUCCEEDED))
// The ¬CANCELLATION_REFUND clause excludes healthy restores AND held-as-credit
// cancels. The capture clause excludes the legitimately-unrestored captured
// shapes — 0%-tier paid cancels (restore amount 0 writes NO row) and
// held-credit refunds. The SUCCEEDED clause excludes settlement WITHOUT cash:
// a fully-credit-covered booking gets a $0 SUCCEEDED payment with no
// transaction ledger rows (booking-create), takes the PAID path, and a
// 0%-tier / fee-swallowed cancel legitimately retains the whole credit slice —
// healing it would hand back policy-retained credit.
// Soft-deleted bookings are included: the ledger rows survive soft-delete and
// the credit is still lost.
//
// KNOWN FALSE NEGATIVE (conservative by design): a pre-#1547 orphan whose
// CANCELLED booking later received late cash is skipped — the inbound
// invoice-paid effects mint a CANCELLATION_REFUND row ("Internet Banking
// payment credit for cancelled booking …", invoice-paid-effects.ts) that
// compensates the CASH, not the applied credit, and this predicate cannot
// structurally tell it from a restore row. Preferring a missed heal over a
// double-restore is deliberate; such bookings need manual review.
//
// Pure local DB repair: no Xero, Stripe, SES, or Sentry calls; money stays in
// integer cents. Every heal restores 100% of the applied credit (ledger truth),
// matching the never-captured cancel path.
