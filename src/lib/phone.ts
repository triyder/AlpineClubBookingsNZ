 * Single source of truth (fork #125 / #37) for whether a member's phone number
 * may be served to a lodge kiosk or lobby-display surface. Two-sided consent
 * with an adults-only floor:
 *   - the lodge must enable phone display (config side), AND
 *   - the member must have opted in on their profile (permission side), AND
 *   - the member must be an adult, regardless of the two settings.
 *
 * Enforced in the SERVING serialisers ONLY (the kiosk `guests/[date]` route and
 * the lobby display-state builder); never in a template or client component
 * (#37 AC4 — no surface may display a number the API did not serve). Defaults on
 * both flags are `false`, so the pre-feature behaviour is "no phone" until a
 * lodge opts its screens in AND the member opts their number in.
