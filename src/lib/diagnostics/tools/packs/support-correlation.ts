/**
 * AI Diagnostics — AID-6A support pack, part 2: BOUNDED, SANITIZED AUDIT
 * CORRELATION (#2375, epic #2369).
 *
 * PERMISSION, and the one rule that shapes this whole file: correlation requires
 * `support:view` AND the affected domain's own `area:view`. #2375 also forbids
 * doing that with one tool and a model-chosen `domain` argument — an argument
 * cannot decide an authorization rule, because ADR-002 authorizes BEFORE arguments
 * are parsed. So there is one FIXED entry per domain, each declaring its own area
 * set and its own closed category filter, and the executor AND-s them freshly on
 * every invocation.
 *
 *   diagnostics.system_event_correlation      support
 *   diagnostics.booking_event_correlation     support + bookings
 *   diagnostics.membership_event_correlation  support + membership
 *   diagnostics.finance_event_correlation     support + finance
 *   diagnostics.lodge_event_correlation       support + lodge
 *
 * THE CATEGORY SETS ARE NO LONGER WRITTEN OUT HERE (#2581). Each entry derives
 * its own set from `AUDIT_CATEGORY_CORRELATION_DOMAIN` in `audit-categories.ts`,
 * which maps every canonical category to exactly one of these five domains. That
 * makes disjointness and total coverage structural rather than assertions checked
 * after the fact: a new category cannot be added without classifying it, and it
 * cannot be classified into two entries. It also fixed a real hole — `family` was
 * written by 27 production sites and named in NO set here, so family evidence was
 * readable through no correlation tool at all.
 *
 * A caller holding only `support:view` is offered — and can only run — the system
 * entry. Asking for `diagnostics.finance_event_correlation` without `finance:view`
 * is denied server-side with `permission_denied` and the missing area named, and the
 * denied rows are not reachable through the entry they can run: the category sets are
 * disjoint and a row carries AT MOST ONE category, so no `payment` or `xero` row can
 * arrive through the system entry. That is the acceptance criterion "missing permission
 * is a denial, not worked around with source inference", enforced by the category
 * filters rather than by discipline.
 *
 * "AT MOST ONE" IS EXACT, AND IT COSTS COVERAGE RATHER THAN CONTAINMENT.
 * `AuditLog.category` is `String?` with no default, and `audit.ts` writes the column
 * only when a caller supplies one — so a row with NO category is possible, and it was
 * common. The executable census of this repository's production audit writes
 * (`scripts/audit/audit-writer-census.ts`, pinned by
 * `src/lib/__tests__/audit-writer-census.test.ts`) counted 82 uncategorised write
 * sites when #2581 opened — 69 `logAudit`, 11 `createAuditLog`, 2 hand-built Prisma
 * writes, none through `createStructuredAuditLog` — and `main` still measured those
 * same 82 immediately before this change, out of 426 write sites in total. #2581's
 * second child classified all 82 at the source, so the census now reads 462 write
 * sites and ZERO uncategorised: no NEW row is born invisible to these five entries.
 *
 * THE GAP HAS NOT CLOSED, IT HAS STOPPED GROWING, and the distinction is the whole
 * reason the declarations below stay. Every row written BEFORE that runtime deployed
 * still carries `category = NULL`, and `WHERE "category" = ANY ($1)` is NULL for such
 * a row, so it is returned by NONE of the five entries. The historical backfill is
 * #2581's third child and has not run. The containment argument is unharmed (a row
 * nobody can reach is not a way around a denial); what is harmed is any reading of an
 * empty result as an absence, which is why every `evidenceScope` and every description
 * still names this gap in as many words. See `DIAGNOSTICS_CORRELATION_CATEGORY_SETS`
 * for why the alternative — routing the null case to the system entry — is an owner
 * decision rather than a fix, and was refused.
 *
 * ONE HONEST QUALIFICATION, because "the domain requirement is what stands between a
 * support-only admin and any domain evidence" would be too strong a claim. The `admin`
 * category is this platform's catch-all for ADMINISTRATOR-INITIATED operations across
 * every domain (see `AUDIT_CATEGORY_CORRELATION_DOMAIN`), so the system entry does
 * report that a member merge, a lifecycle decision or an internet-banking settings
 * change occurred — as an action code, a severity, an entity TYPE and an instant, and
 * nothing else. That is not an escalation: `support` is already the area that governs
 * `/admin/audit-log`, where the same administrator reads those same rows in full.
 * What the domain requirement buys is the DOMAIN'S OWN events — the payment, the
 * booking, the account change itself.
 *
 * THE GRANT. This is the ONLY relation AID-6A adds to the `SELECT_GRANTS` allowlist,
 * and it is granted BY COLUMN, not by table:
 *
 *   GRANT SELECT ("id","action","category","severity","outcome","entityType",
 *                 "requestId","createdAt") ON public."AuditLog"
 *
 * `AuditLog` is exactly the shape #2375 says must not be granted wholesale: it
 * carries `ipAddress`, `userAgent`, `summary`, `details`, arbitrary `metadata` JSON,
 * and three member-identifying columns. A column grant makes the projection a
 * SERVER-ENFORCED boundary rather than an application one — as the diagnostics role,
 * `SELECT "ipAddress" FROM "AuditLog"` is refused by PostgreSQL itself (42501), so a
 * future tool, a future projection bug, or a hand-written query in a psql session
 * with that credential cannot reach it. `database.ts`'s privilege probe verifies the
 * granted COLUMNS against this same allowlist and refuses the role if a wider grant
 * appears, so drift towards a table-level grant fails readiness closed.
 *
 * WHAT IS PROJECTED, and why each field is safe:
 *  - `eventRef`   the audit row's own id. #2375 lists "evidence reference" as an
 *                 approved correlation field, and it is what makes the ORDER BY
 *                 total (so the audit `resultHash` is stable for identical evidence).
 *  - `action`     the stable server-defined action code.
 *  - `category`, `severity`, `outcome`  closed server-side classifications.
 *  - `entityType` WHAT kind of record the event concerned, never WHICH one.
 *  - `requestId`  the correlation key that ties one operator action to the events it
 *                 produced. THE ONE FIELD HERE THAT IS NOT SERVER-DEFINED — see
 *                 `projectRequestId`, which is why it is re-validated on the way out.
 *  - `occurredAtUtc`  ISO-8601 UTC, formatted in SQL (a `Date` is not a flat scalar).
 *
 * WHAT IS NEVER PROJECTED, and there is no argument that can change it:
 * `entityId`, `memberId`, `actorMemberId`, `subjectMemberId`, `targetId`, `summary`,
 * `details`, `metadata`, `ipAddress`, `userAgent`. `entityId` is the deliberate one
 * to explain: it is often a member id, and this pack's permission set is
 * system-plus-domain rather than a per-record investigation with ADR-004's PII
 * opt-in. Per-record evidence — the member, the booking, the payment — is AID-6B
 * (#2376) and AID-6C (#2377) work, under their own area permission and their own
 * privacy review. So every entry here reports `surfacesPersonalData: false` and
 * means it.
 *
 * BOUNDS. One primary correlation input (an exact request id, optional) plus a fixed
 * approved window from a closed enum; newest first; twenty-two events (measured, see
 * `CORRELATION_ROW_LIMIT`); no free-text log search, no `LIKE`, no wildcard, no
 * model-chosen column, ordering or filter.
 *
 * UNTRUSTED TEXT, and one field where "server-defined code" was simply wrong. Seven
 * of the eight projected values are server-defined: the row id, the action code, the
 * three classifications, the entity type and a SQL-formatted instant. `requestId` is
 * not. `audit.ts` → `getAuditRequestContext` sets it from the request's own
 * `x-request-id` / `x-correlation-id` HEADER, with no length cap, no character class
 * and no sanitisation, and stores it verbatim — so any signed-in member can write it
 * (a profile edit or a notification-preference change is category `account`; a lodge
 * arrive/depart is `lodge`; a PIN login or a password reset is `security`, which is
 * the entry a support-only admin gets). It is therefore treated as attacker-chosen
 * text, and defended in two places:
 *
 *  1. HERE, on the way out: `projectRequestId` re-validates it against the same
 *     character class and length the tool's own INPUT accepts, and projects a stable
 *     code instead when it does not conform. That removes both the field-forgery
 *     payload and the 200-character-per-row byte cost that let a member push a
 *     correlation result over its own ceiling and deny the tool for everyone.
 *  2. IN THE RENDERER: `render.ts` neutralises every value (angle brackets and
 *     quotes stripped, wrapper token defused, whitespace collapsed) and QUOTES it, so
 *     a value cannot forge the block delimiter, an attribute, a new row, or — the gap
 *     this pack found — extra `field=value` pairs inside its own row.
 *
 * Both layers stay, deliberately: (1) is specific to this column's provenance and (2)
 * is what the sibling packs' free-text member, lodge, room, and bed names depend on.

/**
 * The window predicate is ALWAYS applied, including when a request id is supplied,

 * index on `requestId`, so a request-id-only predicate would be a sequential scan
 * of the platform's whole access trail against a 5-second statement timeout. Every
 * category this pack filters on IS indexed together with `createdAt`
 * (`@@index([category, createdAt])`), so the window is what keeps the read cheap.
 * The consequence is documented in the tool descriptions: widen the window if the
 * event you are correlating is older than an hour.
 *
 * `$3::text IS NULL OR "requestId" = $3::text` keeps the entry to ONE statement with
 * a fixed parameter arity — the alternative (two SQL texts chosen by an argument)
 * would be a query shape the caller selects, which is the thing this substrate
 * exists to refuse.
 *
 * EVERY TIME EXPRESSION IS TIMEZONE-INDEPENDENT, deliberately. `AuditLog."createdAt"`
 * is a naive `timestamp` holding UTC, so `now()` (a `timestamptz`) is converted to a
 * UTC `timestamp` with `AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'` before the comparison, and `to_char` is
 * applied to the plain column rather than to a `timestamptz`. Both matter: comparing
 * `timestamp` against `timestamptz` directly, or formatting a `timestamptz`, is
 * resolved using the SESSION's `TimeZone`, so on a deployment that sets
 * `Pacific/Auckland` the window would shift by 12-13 hours and the projected instant
 * would be local time labelled `Z`. The executor also pins `TimeZone` to UTC per
 * transaction; this statement does not rely on that.
 *
 * ONE SQL TEXT FOR ALL FIVE ENTRIES, and the category set travels as a BOUND
 * PARAMETER (`$1::text[]`) rather than being formatted into the statement. The
 * category lists are module constants, not caller text, so interpolating them would
 * not have been an injection — but this file would then be the one place in the
 * substrate that builds SQL with string concatenation, and "it is safe because of
 * where the values come from" is an argument a future edit can quietly invalidate.
 * `bind` closes over the ENTRY's own categories, never over an argument, so the
 * permission set and the category filter remain fixed together at review time.

 *
 *  - FIELD FORGERY. The evidence renderer joins `key=value` pairs with `"; "`. A

 *    quotes every value, which closes it generally; this closes it at the source as
 *    well, because a correlation identifier has a known shape and a value that is not
 *    one is not evidence.

/**
 * Twenty-two events, not the fifty #2375 allows as a maximum, and not the thirty an
 * earlier revision claimed rendered whole. MEASURED, because the arithmetic that
 * justified thirty was wrong in both directions:
 *
 *  - The evidence block is capped at 8 000 characters and carries ~1 000 characters
 *    of fixed framing (opening tag, the untrusted-data header, the evidence-state
 *    line, the tool line, the scope line, the notices and the rows header) before a
 *    single row. Real action codes in this repository run to 60 characters
 *    (`booking_request.member_whole_lodge_approve_idempotent_replay`), so a row line
 *    of this shape is ~260-280 characters, not the 230 the old comment assumed.
 *    Thirty rows rendered to exactly 8 000 characters with three rows silently gone
 *    and a fourth cut mid-field.
 *
 *    TWENTY-TWO, AND MEASURED WITH THE `scope:` LINE THIS TIME. Two revisions of this
 *    comment claimed twenty-four rendered "whole with room to spare"; both measured a
 *    block this pack never emits, because the executor attaches every entry's
 *    `evidenceScope` to every result (`invoke.ts`) and those lines run to 627
 *    characters. Re-measured per entry WITH them, at a 24-character request id: the
 *    system entry lists 22 of 24 at a mix of today's real action codes, and every entry
 *    lists 22 of 24 when each row carries the longest real 60-character code
 *    (`booking_request.member_whole_lodge_approve_idempotent_replay`). At 22 all five
 *    render whole in both cases — the worst of them at 7 718 of the 8 000 characters.
 *
 *    THE CEILING IS THEREFORE A MEASUREMENT, NOT A PREFERENCE, and it moves when the
 *    framing does: it dropped from 24 to 22 when the absent-category disclosure was
 *    added to every scope line, which is the correct direction of travel. What it does
 *    NOT have to survive is a hostile width — a member can plant 128-character request
 *    ids and clip any ceiling. That case is safe because the renderer reports its own
 *    clip in the machine-readable state as well as the prose
 *    (`renderToolResultEvidence`): a cap that reads as a flag is acceptable, a cap that
 *    reads as a complete answer is not.
 *  - `canonicalStringify` is `JSON.stringify(value, null, 2)`, so a projected row
 *    costs ~310 bytes rather than ~230. The ceiling below is the measured cost of
 *    twenty-four rows at the widest values this projection can now produce (a
 *    128-character request id, a 200-character action code), with margin.
 *
 * The renderer is honest either way now — it drops whole rows and says how many of
 * how many it listed — so this ceiling is about giving an operator a complete answer
 * rather than about preventing a silent loss.

 * this projected shape:
 *
 *  - 7 302 bytes at typical widths (a 24-character request id, today's real action
 *    codes).
 *  - 9 590 bytes with a request id at the 128-character cap this projection enforces.

/**
 * The audit categories each entry may read — DERIVED, not listed (#2581).
 *
 * `AUDIT_CATEGORY_CORRELATION_DOMAIN` in `audit-categories.ts` maps every
 * canonical category to exactly one of these five domains, so the two properties
 * this pack depends on are now structural rather than checked afterwards (the
 * contract test still pins both, as a regression alarm rather than as the only
 * guarantee):
 *
 *  - DISJOINT, so a row is reachable through at most one permission set. A row carries
 *    at most one category and a category maps to one domain, so these five sets are a
 *    partition of the CATEGORISED audit trail rather than five overlapping views of it.
 *  - TOTAL, so no canonical category is silently readable by nobody. That was not true
 *    before: `family` was written by 27 production sites and named in no set here, so
 *    every family-domain audit event was invisible to Diagnostics. Adding a category to
 *    the taxonomy without classifying it here no longer compiles.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHO GAINS OR LOSES EVIDENCE (#2581 decisions 1, 2 and 7). Both
 * directions are real behaviour changes and are named in the changelog rather than
 * folded into a refactor:
 *
 *  - `communication` LEFT the system entry for the membership entry. Reading
 *    bulk-communication, notice-delivery and age-up-handoff evidence now needs
 *    `membership:view` as well as `support:view`. Those payloads carry recipient email
 *    addresses, and a support-only operator can read them today; that is the narrowing.
 *  - `family` JOINED the membership entry, so 27 sites' evidence moves from
 *    unreadable-by-Diagnostics to `support:view` plus `membership:view`.
 *  - The three nomination writers that wrote the invented `membership` now write
 *    `account`, and the auth-bounce writer that wrote the invented `auth` now writes
 *    `security` — so both populations move from unreadable to their domain's entry
 *    (membership-gated and support-only respectively).
 *
 * THE ABSENT CATEGORY IS THE SAME FAIL-CLOSED DEFAULT, ONE STEP FURTHER OUT, and it is
 * not hypothetical: no production writer omits a category any more (#2581 child 2), but
 * every row written before that runtime deployed does, and the historical backfill is
 * #2581's third child. The admin
 * audit-log screen already treats the null case as ordinary — `audit-query.ts` infers a
 * category from the action for display (`inferAuditCategoryFromAction`) and its category
 * filter matches `{ category: null }` against a table of legacy action patterns
 * (`buildAuditCategoryWhere`, `LEGACY_AUDIT_CATEGORY_ACTION_FILTERS`). A null row is
 * therefore an ordinary row everywhere except here, where it is invisible to all five
 * entries.
 *
 * TWO WAYS TO CLOSE THAT, AND ONLY ONE IS A REVIEWER'S TO TAKE. Declaring the gap — in
 * every `evidenceScope` and every description — is the fail-closed option and the one
 * taken here: the model is told an empty result does not rule out an uncategorised
 * record, which is the same remedy already applied to the category MISMATCH class above.
 * The alternative is to give the SYSTEM entry the null case explicitly
 * (`"category" IS NULL OR "category" = ANY(…)`), which would keep the five sets disjoint
 * and make the evidence complete — but it routes every historical null row, including
 * booking-policy and communications events, to an entry behind `support:view` alone, and
 * it needs a fresh look at the `(category, createdAt)` index against a 5-second statement
 * timeout. The owner refused that route on #2581: the rows get a category at the SOURCE
 * instead (#2581 child 2, done), and the historical rows get one only through a reviewed
 * exact-action mapping (#2581 child 3, outstanding).
 *
 * WHAT THESE SETS ARE NOT, stated plainly because an earlier revision of this comment
 * claimed otherwise and AID-6B/6C are told to extend the taxonomy on this reasoning.
 * The audit taxonomy IS NOT THE ADMIN AREA MAP. It is an older, coarser taxonomy of its
 * own, and it does not partition the platform the way `admin-permissions.ts` does.
 * Three mismatches matter, all verified against the call sites:
 *
 *  - `admin` IS THE CROSS-DOMAIN CATCH-ALL, not a system-only category — 96
 *    production call sites, still the largest of the eleven, covering
 *    admin-initiated operations in EVERY domain: member merge and
 *    member-lifecycle delete/archive (`member-merge.ts`,
 *    `member-lifecycle-actions.ts`), member import and lodge-access changes,
 *    seasonal membership assignments, the internet-banking payment settings,
 *    `booking_request.settings_updated`, chores, lockers, work parties, lodge
 *    instructions, lodge settings, the `LODGE_*` lodge records themselves and
 *    the other-lodges registry (#2749). So
 *    the system entry, behind `support:view` alone, DOES see admin-initiated
 *    domain actions — as metadata, but it sees them. That is also why every NEW
 *    `admin` assignment needs a written justification rather than a default: it
 *    is the widest gate a category can sit behind.
 *
 *    118 -> 96 in #2730, which is the first pass to READ this population rather
 *    than inherit it. BED ALLOCATION IS NO LONGER WRITTEN HERE: its 21
 *    admin-initiated writers now say `lodge`, joining the 7 that always did, so
 *    the lodge entry returns the whole family from this release onwards.
 *    `LODGE_DISPLAY_CONFIG_UPDATED` moved with them, to sit beside its ten
 *    display siblings. Both are NARROWINGS — a support-only operator could
 *    correlate those 22 sites' NEW rows before and cannot now, and needs
 *    `lodge:view` as well. The rest of this population was read and deliberately
 *    KEPT; the per-site record is in
 *    `docs/ai-diagnostics/audit-admin-category-review.md`.
 *
 *    #2730 CHANGED THE WRITERS AND NOT THE STORED ROWS; #2751 CHANGED THE ROWS.
 *    That sequence is why this comment used to say something different, and the
 *    reason is worth keeping: a row already in `AuditLog` keeps the category it
 *    was written with, because `buildAuditCategoryWhere` only ORs the legacy
 *    action-name guess in for rows whose category IS NULL. So between #2730 and
 *    #2751 a stored `"admin"` bed-allocation row was returned by the SYSTEM entry
 *    and by no other, and bed-allocation evidence was split by DATE across the two
 *    entries — which is what both entries' prose had to say while it was true.
 *    #2751's migration
 *    (`prisma/migrations/20260810020000_backfill_bed_allocation_audit_category`)
 *    rewrote those rows to `lodge` for exactly the 18 action names those 22 sites
 *    write, so the lodge entry holds practically the whole family and the system
 *    entry practically none of it. **If you reclassify an audit writer again, this
 *    is the trap: the prose here is about STORED rows, and moving a writer without
 *    moving the rows re-opens the same date split** (INV-OPS-012).
 *
 *    "PRACTICALLY", NOT "ENTIRELY", AND THE STRINGS SAY SO. One residue survives
 *    the backfill, minutes wide rather than release wide: `migrate deploy` runs
 *    before cutover, so a row written by the old colour during the upgrade window
 *    is filed `admin` AFTER the statement has already passed, and keeps `admin`
 *    until the operator re-runs it — which the runbook asks for (§3.2) but
 *    explicitly permits skipping. An earlier draft of this pack left that to
 *    `SHARED_DESCRIPTION_TAIL`, which only tells the model not to settle a
 *    question on ONE EMPTY entry; neither entry is empty in this case (each holds
 *    the rest of the history), so the tail never fires and the model was left with
 *    an absolute "NOT here at all" that the same release documented as possibly
 *    false for ever. That is the #2730 evidence-honesty defect in the opposite
 *    direction, so the residue is now named in the system `scope`, the lodge
 *    `scope` and the lodge `description`, and pinned in both directions by
 *    `support-correlation.test.ts`.
 *  - `lodge` carries INDUCTION (`induction.ts`, `induction-baseline.ts`), even though
 *    `/admin/induction` is a `membership` surface.
 *  - `privacy` carries the admin ISSUE-REPORT events, even though
 *    `/admin/issue-reports` is a `support` surface. Re-mapping them to `admin` to match
 *    the surface would WIDEN them to support-only, so #2581 decision 5 keeps them here.
 *
 * WHY THAT IS NOT AN ESCALATION, and why the fix is honesty rather than a re-map.
 * `support` is already the area that governs `/admin/audit-log` and
 * `/api/admin/audit-log` (`admin-permissions.ts`), where the same administrator can
 * read these same rows IN FULL — summary, details, metadata, IP address, actor. This
 * projection is metadata-only and strictly narrower, so the correlation channel is at
 * every point at least as strict as the admin surface the same permission already
 * opens. Re-mapping is not available either: a row's category is a single string that
 * does not say which surface wrote it, so `admin` cannot be split by category, and
 * adding it to all four domain entries would break the disjointness that makes a
 * denial un-workaroundable.
 *
 * WHAT THE MISMATCH DOES COST is evidence honesty, and that is fixed rather than
 * documented: every entry declares an `evidenceScope` naming the categories it
 * searched, and its description names them too, so an empty result cannot be read as
 * "this did not happen" when the events are simply recorded under another category.
