/**
 * AI Diagnostics — AID-6B booking/membership pack, part 3: PER-MEMBER STORED
 * EVIDENCE (#2376, epic #2369).
 *
 * Five entries, each taking an EXACT member id that `member_search` had to produce
 * first. There is no listing tool here, no window that returns "recent members",
 * and no argument that widens a predicate — so the pack has no shape that could be
 * walked to extract the roll.
 *
 *   diagnostics.member_diagnostic_summary     membership
 *   diagnostics.member_subscription_state     membership
 *   diagnostics.member_family_state           membership
 *   diagnostics.member_booking_summary        membership + bookings
 *   diagnostics.member_record_audit_history   membership
 *
 * PERMISSION. Four of the five require `membership:view` and nothing else: #2376's
 * owner decision is explicit that a domain tool must not also demand
 * `support:view`, and a Membership Officer looking at a member is doing their own
 * job. `member_booking_summary` is the exception and it is deliberate — it combines
 * membership evidence (WHICH member) with booking evidence (THEIR bookings), and
 * the epic's rule for a tool that spans two domains is that it requires both areas,
 * AND-ed.
 *
 * THAT COMBINATION HAS TO BE ITS OWN ENTRY RATHER THAN ONE MORE VALUE IN AN ENUM.
 * `requiredAreas` is fixed on the entry and `invoke.ts` authorizes BEFORE it parses
 * arguments, so an argument can never move a call between permission sets. A single
 * `member_detail` tool taking `include: "bookings" | "family"` would have had to
 * declare both areas (denying a Membership Officer the family half they are
 * entitled to) or one area (handing a Membership Officer without booking access a
 * member's booking history). There is no third option, so there are five tools.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THIS PACK WIDENS, AND THE ARGUMENT FOR IT
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This module WIDENS `Member` from the two columns AID-6C granted — `"id"` and
 * `"xeroContactId"`, for `xero_contact_linkage` — to the identity and lifecycle set
 * enumerated below. `provision-role.ts` calls that two-column grant "the narrowest
 * grant in the file and the one to scrutinise hardest on any future edit". This is
 * that edit, so here is the argument rather than a diff.
 *
 * #2376's owner decision authorises a member's NAME, EMAIL ADDRESS and CONTACT
 * DETAILS as evidence for an EXPLICITLY SELECTED record under `membership:view` —
 * the same permission that already governs Admin > Members, where the same officer
 * reads the same fields on a screen, in bulk, with a CSV export. What the widening
 * buys is that a model answering "why can this member not book" can name the member
 * instead of quoting a cuid at an operator.
 *
 * WHAT STAYS REFUSED BY THE SERVER, not by this file's good intentions. Every one
 * of these is outside the SELECT grant, so PostgreSQL refuses it (42501) to the
 * diagnostics credential in a `psql` session as readily as in a tool:
 *
 *  - CREDENTIALS AND SECURITY POSTURE: `passwordHash`, `totpSecret`, `googleSub`,
 *    every `twoFactor*` column, `forcePasswordChange`, `passwordChangedAt`,
 *    `lastLoginAt`, `emailVerified`.
 *  - THE BIRTH DATE: `dateOfBirth`. Argued in `member_diagnostic_summary` below.
 *  - THE BODY: `gender`, `title`, `occupation`, every `street*` and `postal*`
 *    address column, `photoImageId`/`photoUpdatedAt`/`photoUpdatedByMemberId`.
 *  - FREE TEXT: `comments` (`@db.Text`), `cancelledReason`, `archivedReason`,
 *    `MemberSubscription."manualPaymentNote"` and everything on
 *    `FamilyGroupJoinRequest`.
 *  - AUTHORISATION STATE THIS PACK HAS NO QUESTION FOR: `role`,
 *    `financeAccessLevel`, `postLoginLanding`.
 *  - PLUMBING WHOSE ABSENCE IS NOT A GAP: `inheritParentEmail`,
 *    `inheritEmailFromId`, `lodgeScreenPhoneOptIn`, `detailsConfirmedAt`,
 *    `detailsConfirmedByMemberId`, `onboardingConfirmedAt`, `profileCompletedAt`,
 *    `cancelledViaRequestId`, `archivedViaLifecycleActionRequestId`,
 *    `hutLeaderEligibleAt`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE EXACT COLUMN GRANT THESE FIVE STATEMENTS NEED
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Relation by relation, with the entry that needs each. A column marked
 * [PREDICATE] is READ — in a join, a `WHERE`, or a derived boolean — and NEVER
 * projected; PostgreSQL's column privileges apply to any reference in the
 * statement, including inside `x IS NOT NULL`, so a predicate-only column still has
 * to be granted. An ungranted column is a 42501 at runtime that passes every mock.
 *
 * public."Member"  (aliases m, rm, me, p, d)
 *   PROJECTED
 *     id                    E1 memberRef; E3 relatedMemberRef + relationRef (legs B/C)
 *     firstName             E1; E3 relatedFirstName
 *     lastName              E1; E3 relatedLastName
 *     email                 E1 — the ONLY projected email address in the whole pack,
 *                           AND the erasure marker predicate behind E1
 *                           lifecycleDeleted (`deletedAccountEmailMarkerSql`).
 *                           Dropping this column from the projection would NOT free
 *                           the grant: see "erasure is defined by its markers" below.
 *     ageTier               E1; E3 relatedAgeTier
 *     active                E1 isActive; E3 relatedIsActive
 *     canLogin              E1
 *     cancelledAt           E1 instant; E3 relatedIsCancelled (bool)
 *     archivedAt            E1 instant; E3 relatedIsArchived (bool)
 *     joinedDate            E1
 *     lifeMemberDate        E1
 *     requiresInduction     E1
 *     hutLeaderEligible     E1
 *     parentMemberId        E1 parentMemberRef; E3 leg B arm 1 + leg C arm 1; E1 dependentCount
 *     secondaryParentId     E1 secondaryParentRef; E3 leg B arm 2 + leg C arm 2; E1 dependentCount
 *     familyGroupId         E1 — the DEPRECATED legacy single-group pointer
 *     billingFamilyGroupId  E1
 *     createdAt             E1
 *     updatedAt             E1
 *   [PREDICATE] NEVER PROJECTED
 *     phoneNumber           E1 hasPhone presence test. The NUMBER is never returned
 *                           by any entry in this pack; it is a `member_search`
 *                           PREDICATE an operator already holds.
 *     xeroContactId         E1 hasXeroContact presence test (already granted, AID-6C)
 *   NOT READ AT ALL — see "WHAT STAYS REFUSED BY THE SERVER" above for the list and
 *   the reason for each class.
 *
 * public."MemberSubscription"  (alias s)
 *   PROJECTED
 *     id, seasonYear, status, xeroInvoiceNumber, paidAt, manuallyMarkedPaidAt,
 *     voidGeneration, createdAt, updatedAt                         all E2
 *   [PREDICATE] NEVER PROJECTED
 *     memberId              E2 — the entry's whole `WHERE`
 *     xeroInvoiceId         E2 hasXeroInvoice presence test (the id itself is
 *                           finance evidence and belongs to the finance pack)
 *   NOT READ: `manualPaymentNote`. A `@db.VarChar(500)` operator note, and #2376
 *   refuses operator free text. An earlier revision of this module granted it as a
 *   PREDICATE ONLY, to power a `hasManualPaymentNote` boolean, on the pattern AID-6C
 *   argues for on `PaymentRecoveryOperation."idempotencyKey"`. That grant was
 *   REMOVED before this shipped, and the reasoning is worth keeping: a column
 *   privilege is not a projection: it makes every manual-payment note in the club
 *   readable to anybody holding the diagnostics credential in a `psql` session, and
 *   the boolean bought nothing — `manuallyMarkedPaidAt` already carries the fact
 *   that the row was settled by hand, which is the diagnostically useful half.
 *   `idempotencyKey` earned its grant because the CLASSIFICATION it enables exists
 *   nowhere else; "an operator wrote something down" does not clear that bar.
 *   NOT READ: `xeroOnlineInvoiceUrl` (a live Xero link is not evidence),
 *   `manuallyMarkedPaidByMemberId` (identifies the operator who acted).
 *
 * public."FamilyGroupMember"  (aliases mine, fgm)
 *   PROJECTED
 *     id                    E3 relationRef (leg A only)
 *     joinedAt              E3 joinedAtUtc (leg A only)
 *   [PREDICATE] NEVER PROJECTED
 *     familyGroupId         E3 the self-join that finds the member's groups
 *     memberId              E3 the self-join and the entry's `WHERE`
 *   There is nothing else on this relation. It has NO role column — see E3.
 *
 * public."FamilyGroup"  (alias fg)
 *   PROJECTED
 *     id                    E3 familyGroupRef (also the join key)
 *     name                  E3 familyGroupName — member-supplied free text, stripped
 *                           and bounded by `personNameOrNull`
 *   NOT READ: `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `billingMembershipId` — the group's own
 *   lifecycle is not a member question, and the billing-membership pointer is a
 *   finance fact this pack has no entry for.
 *
 * public."Booking"  (alias b)
 *   PROJECTED
 *     id, lodgeId, status, checkIn, checkOut, finalPriceCents, deletedAt, createdAt
 *                                                                        all E4
 *   [PREDICATE] NEVER PROJECTED
 *     memberId              E4 — `= $1` on the OWNER leg, `<> $1` on the GUEST leg
 *   Every one of these is already granted for `booking_search`; E4 adds no new
 *   `Booking` column. NOT READ by E4: `notes`, `adminReviewNotes`,
 *   `memberReviewJustification`, `deletedReason`, `adultMemberHostingReview` (a
 *   frozen policy JSON blob) and every `*ById` actor column.
 *
 * public."BookingGuest"  (aliases g, gm, gp)
 *   [PREDICATE] NEVER PROJECTED — no COLUMN VALUE from this relation leaves this
 *   module. One derived BOOLEAN does (`memberOperationallyPresent`), which is a
 *   predicate's answer rather than a column, on the same terms as
 *   `booking_party_state`'s `operationallyPresent`.
 *     bookingId             E4 the party-size subquery, the GUEST-leg `EXISTS` and
 *                           the presence lateral
 *     memberId              E4 the GUEST-leg `EXISTS` and the presence lateral.
 *                           NEW: `booking_search` reads only `bookingId`, so
 *                           `memberId` is this module's one addition to the
 *                           `BookingGuest` grant.
 *     consentStatus         E4 the canonical operational-presence predicate. Already
 *                           granted for `booking_party_state`, which both projects
 *                           it and precomputes the same predicate, so this adds no
 *                           column to the allowlist — only a second reader.
 *   NOT READ: `firstName`, `lastName` (a guest's name is the booking pack's
 *   business, under `bookings:view`, not a membership answer), `ageTier`,
 *   `priceCents`, the other `consent*` columns (`consentRequestedAt`,
 *   `consentRespondedAt`, `consentRespondedByMemberId`, `consentExpiresAt`),
 *   `arrivedAt`, `departedAt`.
 *
 * public."Lodge"  (alias l)
 *   PROJECTED
 *     name                  E4 lodgeName
 *   [PREDICATE] NEVER PROJECTED
 *     id                    E4 the LEFT JOIN key (E4 projects `Booking."lodgeId"`,
 *                           not `Lodge."id"`, so the two agree by construction)
 *   Both already granted for `booking_search`.
 *
 * public."AuditLog"  (alias a)
 *   PROJECTED
 *     id, action, category, severity, outcome, entityType, createdAt      all E5
 *   [PREDICATE] NEVER PROJECTED
 *     entityId              E5 — matched against an id the caller already supplied
 *   Every one of these is already granted (AID-6A, plus `entityId` from AID-6C);
 *   E5 adds nothing. Still ungranted and still not read: `memberId`,
 *   `actorMemberId`, `subjectMemberId`, `summary`, `details`, `metadata`,
 *   `ipAddress`, `userAgent`.
 *   GRANTED BUT NOT READ, one column: `requestId`. AID-6A granted it for the five
 *   correlation entries that project it as their correlation key; E5 does not read
 *   it, so a future field here would need no grant change — and `tools/render.ts`
 *   flags it as verbatim client header text, which is why that matters.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TWO PROPERTIES THAT ARE PROPERTIES OF THE CODE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * NO PATTERN LANGUAGE. Every predicate in this module is `=`, `<>`, `IS NULL`,
 * `IS NOT NULL` or `= ANY(array)`. There is no `LIKE`, no `ILIKE`, no `SIMILAR TO`,
 * no regex operator and no `starts_with` here, so a wildcard character in an
 * argument has nothing to mean — and every argument is an exact record id or a key
 * from a closed server-owned map anyway.
 *
 * ADR-004's PER-INVOCATION OPT-IN FOR PERSONAL DATA IS ENFORCED (AID-7a, #2785).
 * `surfacesPersonalData` is set truthfully on every entry below, and it is now the
 * trigger for `invoke.ts` gate 4b: such an entry runs only when the operator ticked
 * personal details AND this investigation covers the record it names. Each entry
 * therefore also declares which record that is, and `member_record_audit_history`
 * — which surfaces no personal fields — declares one too, because reading ONE named
 * record's history is bounded by the investigation whether or not the row carries a
 * name. That sits on top of what always bounded this pack: the AND-ed area check,
 * the fixed statements, the column grant, the per-session call ceiling and the
 * audit row.

/**
 * ONE ROW: who this member is and what state their membership is in.
 *
 * THIS IS THE ONE PLACE IN THE WHOLE PACK THAT RETURNS AN EMAIL ADDRESS. #2376
 * authorises it by name as evidence for an explicitly SELECTED record, so it is
 * returned for exactly one member the operator already identified — and a SEARCH
 * returns only whether an address is on file (`member_search`'s `hasEmail`), never
 * the value, so a harvested page of search rows is a list of names and never a list
 * of contactable addresses. `emailOrNull` re-validates the column on the way out
 * rather than trusting it: `Member."email"` is stored as entered, nothing
 * normalises it, and a value carrying `;` or `=` would forge a field in the
 * rendered evidence block. It is deliberately NOT lower-cased — an operator
 * comparing the stored address against what the member told them needs the stored
 * form, and case-folding it would hide the mismatch that is sometimes the answer.
 *
 * THE PHONE NUMBER IS A BOOLEAN, AND THAT IS A DECISION RATHER THAN AN OVERSIGHT.
 * `hasPhone` says whether a number is on file; the number itself is granted as a
 * `member_search` PREDICATE — the operator typed it in, so they already hold it —
 * and is projected by nothing. THE REJECTED ALTERNATIVE was to project it here
 * alongside the email, on the reasoning that #2376 authorises "contact details" and
 * one selected record cannot be harvested. It was rejected because the email
 * address is what an officer needs to answer the questions this pack exists for
 * ("the member says they never got the confirmation", "which account did they log
 * in as") and the phone number answers none of them, so the number is cost with no
 * diagnostic benefit. `hasPhone` uses `phoneNumber IS NOT NULL AND <> ''` — the
 * SAME test as `member_search`'s `has_phone` and as the application's own
 * `formatMemberPhone`, which returns null on a missing `phoneNumber` — so the
 * search and the summary can never disagree about whether a member is reachable.
 *
 * NO DATE OF BIRTH IS PROJECTED AND NONE IS GRANTED. Age-based eligibility in this
 * platform is decided on `ageTier`, not on an age computed from a birth date:
 * `AgeTierSetting` keys `subscriptionRequiredForBooking` on the tier,
 * `BookingGuest` stores the tier on the guest row, and
 * `participantQualifiesAsHost` (`src/lib/policies/adult-member-hosting.ts`) reads
 * the tier. So the TIER is the authoritative fact, and the birth date is not needed
 * to report eligibility or to explain a refusal.
 * `admin-family-group-member-search.ts` sets the same precedent already: it returns
 * a calculated age LABEL to an administrator and never the date. A model handed a
 * birth date would also volunteer an age, which is a second, derived claim this
 * pack has no need to make.
 *
 * THERE IS NO MEMBER NUMBER IN THIS SCHEMA, so no such field is reported. `Member`
 * carries a cuid `id`, an `email` and a `xeroContactId`; a grep of the whole tree
 * for `memberNumber`/`membershipNumber` finds no column, only one comment in
 * `member-merge.ts`. A member who quotes "their membership number" is quoting
 * something else — a Xero contact number or an invoice number, both finance
 * records — and the scope line says so, because a tool that invented the field
 * would have a model tell an officer to read a number off a card the club has never
 * issued.
 *
 * `lifecycle_deleted` IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DERIVED COLUMN HERE, and the reason is
 * specific. An ANONYMISED (erased) account is `active = false` with `cancelledAt`
 * NULL and `archivedAt` NULL, because erasure stamps NEITHER instant — so a naive
 * three-column read reports an erased member as merely "Inactive", and a model shown
 * that will tell an officer to reactivate an account that no longer has a person
 * behind it. The flag exists to close that.
 *
 * IT WAS THAT THREE-COLUMN SHAPE ITSELF UNTIL #2679's REVIEW, and that was the same
 * error pointing the other way. Ordinary bulk DEACTIVATION is `active = false` with
 * neither instant too — it is reversible and routine — so a shape test reported
 * every deactivated member as possibly erased. Both mistakes send an officer to the
 * wrong action; erasure is defined by its MARKERS, never by the absence of other
 * markers. The column now runs `deletedAccountEmailMarkerSql`, the SQL half of the
 * platform's own `isDeletedAccountRecord` (`INV-LIFE-013`), keyed on the anonymised
 * address the deletion writes.
 *
 * SO `Member."email"` IS NOW A PREDICATE AS WELL AS A PROJECTION, and the grant
 * table above says so on its own row rather than leaving it to this paragraph.
 * `active`, `cancelledAt` and `archivedAt` no longer contribute to
 * `lifecycleDeleted` at all — they are read for their own projected fields and
 * nothing else. The reason to state it twice is a concrete trap: a later privacy
 * tightening that drops the email ADDRESS from this entry's projection (plausible —
 * `member_search` already refuses to project it) would look at a table attributing
 * the erasure marker to the three lifecycle columns, drop the `email` grant with the
 * field, and turn the marker into a runtime 42501 on the one entry whose whole point
 * is that erasure is not inferred from inactivity.
 * `diagnostics.member_eligibility_state` is the entry
 * that tests BOTH markers — it compares the sentinel password hash inside
 * PostgreSQL, a column this role is not granted — and gives the platform's own
 * authoritative lifecycle label.
 *
 * A BOOLEAN RATHER THAN THE XERO CONTACT ID, on purpose. `hasXeroContact` says a
 * link exists; the id itself is FINANCE evidence, and
 * `diagnostics.xero_contact_linkage` already returns it — under `finance:view` AND
 * `membership:view`, which is the pair of permissions a Xero identifier should cost.
 * Projecting it here would hand it to a `membership:view`-only officer and quietly
 * make that entry's second area check decorative.
 *
 * `legacy_family_group_ref` IS THE DEPRECATED COLUMN AND IS LABELLED AS SUCH.
 * `Member."familyGroupId"` is the legacy single-group pointer; `FamilyGroupMember`
 * is authoritative and a member may belong to more than one group, which is why
 * `Member."billingFamilyGroupId"` exists at all. It is projected because a stale or
 * disagreeing legacy pointer is a real cause of a real class of confusion, and the
 * scope line names `member_family_state` as the authority.
 *
 * `dependent_count` IS A `count(*)`, SO 0 MEANS "no member row points at this
 * member as a parent" and never "unknown". It counts BOTH parent links —
 * `parentMemberId = m."id" OR secondaryParentId = m."id"` — because a split family
 * records the second parent in the second column, and a count over the first alone
 * would report a co-parent as having no children.

This platform records NO member number, so a member quoting one is quoting a Xero contact number or an invoice number, which are finance records these tools do not search. lifecycleDeleted is TRUE only when this record carries the anonymisation marker an approved deletion writes, so it means the account was ERASED: there is no longer a person behind it, and you must never suggest reactivating or contacting them. It is NOT an inference from inactivity, and an inactive, cancelled or archived member is a reversible administrative state for which lifecycleDeleted is FALSE — read isActive, cancelledAtUtc and archivedAtUtc for those. diagnostics.member_eligibility_state tests both deletion markers and gives the platform's own authoritative lifecycle label. legacyFamilyGroupRef is the DEPRECATED single-group pointer on the member row: diagnostics.member_family_state is authoritative for family membership, and the two disagreeing is itself a finding. hasXeroContact says only that a link exists; the Xero contact id is finance evidence and needs diagnostics.xero_contact_linkage, which requires finance access as well. joinedDate and lifeMemberDate are calendar days and their columns hold days - both are PostgreSQL DATE, so each day reported is the day stored, with no time of day and no timezone in it. Neither is a lodge night. updatedAtUtc is when ANY column on this row last changed and is NOT when anything was verified. ${AID6B_SCOPE_TAIL} ${AID6B_UNTRUSTED_EVIDENCE_DISCLOSURE}`,

Report this row as the stored record and defer the verdict to that tool. The status values are not interchangeable: NOT_INVOICED means nobody has billed this member for that season yet, which is NOT unpaid and NOT a debt; NOT_REQUIRED and PAID both mean "settled", but one means "the rule never asked" and the other means "money arrived", and telling an officer the wrong one sends them to the wrong screen. A subscription with manuallyMarkedPaidAtUtc set was settled OUTSIDE the Xero pipeline — cash, or a bank transfer reconciled by hand — so it has no Xero payment to look up and nothing to reverse in Xero. Whether an operator wrote down WHY is not reported: the note is operator free text and the diagnostics credential cannot read it. A non-zero voidGeneration means this season's Xero invoice was voided or deleted at least once and the coverage claim released, which is the usual explanation for an apparent double invoice. A member with no rows at all has never had a subscription record created, which is a different fact from having an unpaid one.

 *   PARENT                  this member's parentMemberId / secondaryParentId
 *   DEPENDENT               every member whose parent link points HERE
 *
 * FIVE `UNION ALL` ARMS, NOT THREE, and the extra two are a correctness fix rather
 * than a style. The PARENT and DEPENDENT legs are each split into a primary-link
 * arm and a secondary-link arm so `is_secondary_parent` says WHICH column carried
 * the link. A single arm joined on `p."id" = me."parentMemberId" OR p."id" =
 * me."secondaryParentId"` collapses to ONE row when both columns name the same
 * member, and any expression computing the flag from that row has to pick a lie.
 * Two arms report the two facts.
 *
 * `relation_ref` MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS PER LEG, and that is stated on the entry
 * rather than hidden. For FAMILY_GROUP_CO_MEMBER it is the `FamilyGroupMember` join
 * row's own id — so the same co-member shared through two groups is two
 * distinguishable rows. For PARENT and DEPENDENT there is no join row at all (the
 * link is a column on `Member`), so it is the related member's own id and equals
 * `related_member_ref`. It is an EVIDENCE REFERENCE — the stable identity of this
 * row for the audit hash and for an operator quoting it back — and never a join key
 * to hand to another tool. The tool to hand a member id to is
 * `related_member_ref`.
 *
 * THE LEG-A SELF-JOIN CANNOT DUPLICATE A ROW, and the reason is a database
 * constraint rather than an argument: `FamilyGroupMember` is
 * `@@unique([familyGroupId, memberId])`, so `mine` matches at most one row per
 * group and the join fans out only over the group's OTHER members.
 *
 * THE `ORDER BY` IS TOTAL ACROSS THE UNION, and it needs six keys to be. The four
 * #2376 asks for — kind, family name, given name, related member id — are NOT total
 * on their own: leg A can return the same co-member twice (two shared groups) and
 * legs B and C can return the same member twice (both parent columns), and both
 * pairs tie on all four. Adding `is_secondary_parent` then `relation_ref` makes
 * `(relation_kind, is_secondary_parent, relation_ref)` unique across the whole
 * union, so identical evidence hashes identically for the audit trail. The
 * ordering keys are OUTPUT COLUMN NAMES because a set operation's `ORDER BY` cannot
 * see the input relations. `related_last_name` and `related_first_name` are NOT
 * NULL on `Member`, so no null-ordering rule is load-bearing.

/**
 * THE ONE ENTRY IN THIS MODULE THAT SPANS TWO DOMAINS, and therefore the one that
 * requires two areas.
 *
 * It combines membership evidence (which member) with booking evidence (their
 * bookings), which is exactly the combination the epic says requires every relevant
 * area, AND-ed — so `requiredAreas` is `["membership", "bookings"]` and the executor
 * re-reads both on every invocation. `xero_contact_linkage` in the finance pack is
 * the same shape for the same reason.
 *
 * IT IS A SEPARATE ENTRY RATHER THAN ONE MORE VALUE IN AN ENUM ON ENTRY 1, and that
 * is forced rather than chosen: `requiredAreas` is fixed on the entry and
 * `invoke.ts` authorizes BEFORE it parses arguments, so an argument can never move a
 * call between permission sets. A `member_diagnostic_summary` with an
 * `include: "bookings"` option would have to declare both areas always — locking a
 * Membership Officer out of the identity half they are entitled to — or one area,
 * which would hand a member's booking history to an officer with no booking access.
 *
 * TWO `UNION ALL` LEGS, DISJOINT BY CONSTRUCTION. The OWNER leg is
 * `Booking."memberId" = $1`; the GUEST leg is `Booking."memberId" <> $1` plus an
 * `EXISTS` over a `BookingGuest` row naming this member. `Booking."memberId"` is NOT
 * NULL in this schema, so `<>` cannot silently drop a row to three-valued logic, and
 * the two predicates partition the relation — which is what makes `booking_ref` a
 * total tiebreaker across the whole union.
 *
 * `guest_count` IS THE WHOLE PARTY, not this member's rows in it. It is a
 * `count(*)` over every `BookingGuest` row on the booking, so 0 means the booking
 * has no guest rows at all rather than "unknown", and it is the same subquery
 * `booking_search` uses so the two entries can never disagree about a party size.
 *
 * NO `BookingGuest` COLUMN VALUE IS PROJECTED. Its three granted columns are read
 * as predicates only. A guest's name is booking-pack evidence under
 * `bookings:view`, and returning the party here would make this entry a second,
 * drifting answer to the party question `diagnostics.booking_party_state` owns.
 *
 * `member_operationally_present` IS THE ONE THING THAT CROSSES, and it is a
 * predicate's ANSWER rather than a column. The entry used to report `involvement:
 * 'GUEST'` from a bare `EXISTS` over `BookingGuest`, with nothing on the row and
 * nothing in the scope line about consent — so a member who was invited as a
 * cross-family member guest and DECLINED was reported as a guest on that booking.
 * Those rows survive: `member-guest-consent.ts` states in as many words that a
 * PENDING row "holds a bed (D-4) and nothing else" and that a DECLINED or EXPIRED
 * row which survived its removal attempt "is not an occupant either", and
 * `MEMBER_GUEST_CONSENT_SUB_STATES` enumerates both as reachable persisted states.
 * An officer asking "why is this member on that booking" or "were they there" was
 * being told they were a guest on it.
 *
 * The predicate is the platform's own, in SQL:
 * `OPERATIONALLY_PRESENT_GUEST_WHERE` is `consentStatus IS NULL OR consentStatus =
 * 'CONFIRMED'`, the same text `booking_party_state` precomputes, and NULL is the
 * dominant value forever — every non-member guest, every family-scope guest and
 * every pre-feature row carries one — so the naive `consentStatus <> 'PENDING'`
 * would be UNKNOWN for those rows and silently drop every ordinary guest.
 *
 * IT IS THREE-VALUED, on the same discipline as `booking_party_state`'s
 * `nightsAreContiguous`. NULL means this member holds NO guest row on the booking
 * at all, which is the ordinary shape of an OWNER who booked for other people — and
 * a `false` there would be a specific claim ("they are on the booking but not
 * present") that is simply untrue. The ROW SET is unchanged: a declined invitation
 * is still returned, because "why is this booking in their list" is exactly the
 * question being asked, and it is now answerable.

Requires BOTH membership and booking access, because it joins who the member is to what they booked. It is a RECENT-INVOLVEMENT SUMMARY and NOT a complete history: never answer "how many bookings has this member had" from it, and never present its count as a total.

  evidenceScope: `At most ${AID6B_HISTORY_ROW_LIMIT} bookings this member is involved in, LATEST NIGHTS FIRST. It is a recent-involvement summary and NOT a complete history: a member with more bookings than the cap has the older ones silently outside this result, which the truncation flag reports, so NEVER answer "how many bookings has this member had", "when did they first stay" or "have they ever stayed at X" from these rows — the count here is the number of rows returned and nothing more. A member appears as GUEST on somebody else's booking and as OWNER on their own, so the same person can legitimately appear in both involvements, and the same STAY can produce TWO rows when a split member/non-member party was stored as a parent booking plus a child booking. Soft-deleted bookings ARE included, with their deletion instant, because "the booking has vanished" is usually a question about exactly those rows — never describe a booking with a deletion instant as active. finalPriceCents is the booking's stored price in integer cents and says NOTHING about whether it was paid: an unpaid booking looks identical here to a paid one, and payment evidence needs finance access and the finance tools. guestCount is the size of the WHOLE party on that booking, not this member's part of it. INVOLVEMENT IS NOT ATTENDANCE, and memberOperationallyPresent is what settles it: involvement GUEST means only that a guest row on that booking names this member, and a member invited as a cross-family MEMBER GUEST who DECLINED, or who has not answered, or whose invitation EXPIRED, still has that row. memberOperationallyPresent is the platform's own presence predicate for this member's rows on that booking — true means at least one of their rows counts them as an occupant, false means none does (they were invited and are not coming, though a pending invitation may still be holding a bed), and null means they hold no guest row on that booking at all, which is the ordinary shape of an OWNER who booked for other people. So NEVER answer "was this member at the lodge" or "who was on this booking" from involvement alone: a false there means they did not accept, and reporting them as a guest on the booking would be wrong. Why the declined row is still returned: "why is this booking in their list" is exactly the question being asked, and the answer is on the row. ${AID6B_SCOPE_TAIL} ${AID6B_UNTRUSTED_EVIDENCE_DISCLOSURE}`,

/**
 * The closed map from a FRIENDLY SUBJECT to the `AuditLog."entityType"` values it
 * covers. Modelled on `finance-records.ts`'s `FINANCE_AUDIT_SUBJECTS`: the model
 * picks a word, the entry closes over the server-owned array of column values that
 * word means, so the model cannot name a column value at all and the mapping is
 * reviewable in one place.
 *
 * FOUR SUBJECTS WERE PROPOSED AND DROPPED, and the reason is the finding rather
 * than an omission. AID-6C's review caught three subjects that could never match,
 * and its conclusion applies here in full: an empty result from a tool whose own
 * scope line says "nothing in THOSE categories matched" reads as evidence of
 * absence, so a subject that cannot match is worse than no subject. This predicate
 * is `entityType = ANY(...) AND entityId = ... AND category = ANY(membership
 * categories)`, so a subject only works if some production writer pairs that
 * entity type with a category in the MEMBERSHIP correlation domain — `account`,
 * `family`, `communication` and `privacy`, per
 * `AUDIT_CATEGORY_CORRELATION_DOMAIN`. Every literal below was verified at a real
 * write site, and so was the category each of those sites writes:
 *
 *  - DROPPED `induction` → `["MemberInduction"]`. The literal is real — five write
 *    sites in `src/lib/induction.ts` — but every one of them writes
 *    `category: "lodge"`, and `lodge` maps to the LODGE correlation domain, not the
 *    membership one. So the subject could only ever return zero rows. #2376
 *    suspected this and asked for it to be verified; it is true, and the subject is
 *    gone rather than shipped with a caveat, because a caveat in a scope line does
 *    not stop a model from calling the tool and narrating the emptiness. Induction
 *    events are readable through the LODGE correlation entry, and the scope line
 *    says so.
 *  - DROPPED `subscription` → `["MemberSubscription"]`. Both write sites
 *    (`src/lib/manual-subscription-payment.ts`) write `category: "payment"`, which
 *    is the FINANCE domain. It already has a working home:
 *    `diagnostics.finance_record_audit_history` carries the subject
 *    `membership_subscription` over exactly this entity type under the finance
 *    categories. Duplicating it here under a filter that cannot match would be a
 *    second answer that is always empty.
 *  - DROPPED `lifecycle_request` → `["MemberLifecycleActionRequest"]`. All six
 *    write sites in `src/lib/member-lifecycle-actions.ts` write
 *    `category: "admin"`, which maps to the SYSTEM domain and needs `support:view`.
 *    Readable through the system correlation entry, not here.
 *  - `member_number` was never proposed: there is no such column (see entry 1).
 *
 * THE FOUR THAT SURVIVE, each verified at a write site with a membership-domain
 * category:
 *
 *  - `member` → `["Member"]`. `account` at `members/[id]/photo/route.ts` and
 *    `nomination.ts`, `family` at `members/family/[memberId]/details/route.ts`,
 *    `communication` at `cron-age-up.ts` and `token-email-recovery.ts`. Note that
 *    MANY `Member` events are written under `xero`, `admin`, `lodge` or `booking`
 *    and will NOT appear here; the scope line says so.
 *  - `family_request` → `["FamilyGroupJoinRequest"]`. `family`, at thirteen write
 *    sites — five in `admin-family-group-requests-service.ts` and eight across the
 *    seven `api/members/family/*` routes. The AUDIT ROW is readable; the request record
 *    itself is not granted (it carries requester free text and children's dates of
 *    birth), and this entry projects only codes and an instant either way.
 *  - `partner_link` → `["MemberPartnerLink"]`. `family`, at eight write sites in
 *    `member-partner-link.ts` and `partner-invite-token.ts`.
 *  - `cancellation_request` → `["MembershipCancellationRequest"]`. `account`, at
 *    six write sites in `membership-cancellation-requests.ts` and
 *    `membership-cancellation-admin.ts`.

First, the audit category is OPTIONAL on the row, and a row written with NO category at all is matched by no diagnostics tool anywhere, so a real event can exist and be invisible to every one of these tools. Second, several kinds of event on these very records are deliberately filed in OTHER domains and cannot be read here whatever the subject: INDUCTION events are recorded under the "lodge" category, which is not in the membership correlation domain, so induction sign-off, expiry and reminder events will NOT appear here at all and need the lodge tools; subscription events are recorded under "payment" and need the finance tools; member archive and erase LIFECYCLE requests are recorded under "admin" and need the system tools; and Xero contact sync on a member is recorded under "xero".
