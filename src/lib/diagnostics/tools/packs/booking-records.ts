/**
 * AI Diagnostics — AID-6B booking/membership pack, part 2: PER-BOOKING STORED
 * EVIDENCE (#2376, epic #2369).
 *
 * SIX ENTRIES, each taking the EXACT booking id that `booking-search.ts` had to
 * produce first. There is no listing tool here, no window that returns "recent
 * bookings", and no argument that widens a predicate — so this half of the pack
 * has no shape that could be walked to extract a guest register.
 *
 *   diagnostics.booking_diagnostic_summary          bookings
 *   diagnostics.booking_linked_state                bookings
 *   diagnostics.booking_party_state                 bookings
 *   diagnostics.booking_bed_allocation_state        bookings + membership
 *   diagnostics.booking_exception_request_state     bookings
 *   diagnostics.booking_record_audit_history        bookings
 *
 * PERMISSION. Five entries need `bookings:view` only. Bed-allocation state needs
 * BOTH `bookings:view` and `membership:view`: its double-bed verdict reads the
 * live membership eligibility and partner link of both occupants, and the other
 * occupant may belong to another booking. No entry needs `support:view`.
 * `requiredAreas` is fixed on the entry and `invoke.ts` authorizes BEFORE it
 * parses arguments, so a denied membership source is never queried or inferred.
 *
 * A GUEST NAME IS RETURNED, AND THAT IS THE ONE REAL WIDENING IN THIS MODULE.
 * `booking_party_state` projects each guest's given and family name, which #2376
 * lists as approved evidence for an explicitly selected booking — the party of
 * one booking an officer already has open, which is what the admin booking page
 * shows the same officer. Every name goes out through `personNameOrNull`
 * (control characters removed, quotes/`;`/`=` stripped, 60 characters, marked
 * when clipped), and the four entries that project a person's identifier declare
 * `surfacesPersonalData`.
 *
 * ADR-004's PER-INVOCATION OPT-IN IS ENFORCED (AID-7a, #2785). Setting
 * `surfacesPersonalData: true` records that a row can identify a person, and it is
 * now what makes `invoke.ts` gate 4b require the operator's personal-details tick
 * for that entry. Every entry below therefore also declares WHICH record it is
 * about (`consentRecordKind` + `consentRecordArgKey`), because the gate refuses an
 * entry whose record it cannot identify, and `defineDiagnosticsTool` refuses to
 * define one that surfaces personal data and names neither a record nor a search.
 * It sits on top of the controls that were always here: the fixed `bookings:view`
 * requirement, the exact-id argument shape, the column allowlist, the column
 * GRANT, and the audit row.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE COLUMN GRANT — the exhaustive list, relation by relation
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * An UNGRANTED column is a `42501` at runtime that passes every mock, so this
 * list is the contract between this module and `SELECT_GRANTS`. "(predicate)"
 * means the column is only ever compared, never projected.
 *
 * `public."Booking"` — booking_diagnostic_summary ONLY (entries 2-5 key off
 * their own relation's `bookingId` and read no `Booking` column at all):
 *   id (predicate + bookingRef + bookingReference), memberId, lodgeId, status,
 *   checkIn, checkOut, totalPriceCents, discountCents, promoAdjustmentCents,
 *   finalPriceCents, creditElectionCents, hasNonMembers, nonMemberHoldUntil,
 *   parentBookingId, draftExpiresAt, adminReviewStatus,
 *   adultMemberHostingReviewStatus, wholeLodgeHold, deletedAt, createdAt,
 *   updatedAt.
 *  NOT READ, NOT GRANTED, and each for its own reason: `notes`,
 *  `adminReviewReason`, `adminReviewNotes`, `memberReviewJustification`,
 *  `adultMemberHostingReviewReason` and `deletedReason` are member or officer
 *  FREE TEXT; `adultMemberHostingReview` is a raw Json snapshot;
 *  `createdById`, `deletedById`, `adminReviewedById`,
 *  `adultMemberHostingReviewedById`, `adminCapacityHoldByMemberId`,
 *  `capacityOverriddenByMemberId`, `wholeLodgeHoldByMemberId` and
 *  `noEmailsByMemberId` NAME PEOPLE. See "the presence-boolean trap" below for
 *  why no `hasNotes`-style boolean is projected either.
 *
 * `public."BookingGuest"`:
 *   bookingId (predicate — booking_party_state and the guest count on
 *     booking_diagnostic_summary),
 *   id, firstName, lastName, ageTier, isMember, memberId, stayStart, stayEnd,
 *   priceCents, consentStatus, consentRequestedAt, consentRespondedAt,
 *   consentRespondedByMemberId, consentExpiresAt
 *   — all booking_party_state.
 *  All five consent discriminator columns are READ BUT NEVER PROJECTED: the
 *  canonical `classifyMemberGuestConsent` helper folds them into the one
 *  `consentSubState` code; status alone also feeds the platform's canonical
 *  `operationallyPresent` predicate.
 *  NOT READ, NOT GRANTED: `rateMembershipTypeId` (a pricing snapshot that is not
 *  evidence about the guest), `arrivedAt`, `departedAt` and `createdAt` (dropped
 *  for the byte ceiling, see below). The responder id is compared only to the
 *  target id and never emitted; expiry is used only as a presence fact.
 *
 * `public."BookingGuestNight"` — booking_party_state:
 *   bookingGuestId (predicate), stayDate.
 *  NOT READ, NOT GRANTED: `id`, `priceCents`, `createdAt`. The per-night price
 *  is not needed to answer any question this entry is for, and the booking's own
 *  money is on the summary.
 *
 * `public."BedAllocation"` — booking_bed_allocation_state:
 *   bookingId (predicate), id (ORDER BY tiebreak only), bookingGuestId, roomId
 *   (predicate — the composite bed join), bedId (predicate), stayDate, bedType,
 *   isSecondOccupant.
 *  NOT READ, NOT GRANTED: `approvedByMemberId` (names the officer who approved
 *  the placement), `source`, `approvedAt` and `createdAt` (dropped for the byte
 *  ceiling), `updatedAt`.
 *
 * `public."LodgeRoom"` — booking_bed_allocation_state:
 *   id (predicate), name.
 *  NOT READ, NOT GRANTED: `notes` (officer free text), `sortOrder`, `active`,
 *  `lodgeId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.
 *
 * `public."LodgeBed"` — booking_bed_allocation_state:
 *   id (predicate), roomId (predicate), name, bedType (compared, never
 *   projected — the projected type is the allocation's own copy).
 *  NOT READ, NOT GRANTED: `sortOrder`, `active` and `bunkGroup` (dropped for the
 *  byte ceiling), `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.
 *
 * `public."BookingChangeRequest"` — booking_exception_request_state:
 *   bookingId (predicate), id, kind, status, requestedByMemberId,
 *   aggregateCapacityMode, attemptCount, conflictCount, lastConflictAt,
 *   holdExpiresAt, reviewedAt, cancelledAt,
 *   supersededByRequestId, linkedModificationId, createdAt, updatedAt.
 *  NOT READ, NOT GRANTED: `reviewedByMemberId` — it names the OFFICER who
 *  decided, and AID-6C's grant policy refuses every actor id on every relation it
 *  reads for exactly that reason; `reviewedAt` already carries the fact that a
 *  decision was made, which is the half an operator can act on, and the officer
 *  queue shows who. Also `requestedChanges`, `proposalSnapshot` and
 *  `frozenEvidence` (raw Json); `reason`, `adminNotes`, `internalNotes`,
 *  `memberMessage` and `lastConflictReason` (member and officer free text —
 *  `internalNotes` is the column the schema marks NEVER member-visible);
 *  `proposalHash`, `openStateKey` and `version` (machine tokens no operator can
 *  act on).
 *
 * `public."PolicyExceptionReservationNight"` — booking_exception_request_state:
 *   changeRequestId (predicate; also what makes the `count(*)` legal).
 *  NOT READ, NOT GRANTED: `id`, `lodgeId`, `night`, `beds`, `createdAt`. The
 *  entry reports HOW MANY nights are held, never which or how many beds — the
 *  lodge-wide picture is the capacity entry's job, under the same permission.
 *
 * `public."AuditLog"` — booking_record_audit_history:
 *   entityType (predicate + projected), entityId (predicate), category
 *   (predicate + projected), id, action, severity, outcome, createdAt.
 *  NOT READ, NOT GRANTED: `memberId`, `actorMemberId`, `subjectMemberId`,
 *  `targetId` (all name people), `summary`, `details` (free text), `metadata`
 *  (arbitrary Json), `ipAddress`, `userAgent`, `retentionClass`, `expiresAt`,
 *  `archivedAt`, `incidentPreserved`.
 *  NOT READ, BUT GRANTED — one column, named separately because it is the single
 *  place on this relation where those two answers differ, and because an earlier
 *  revision of this paragraph listed it above and then contradicted itself in its
 *  own closing sentence: `requestId`. AID-6A granted it for the five correlation
 *  entries, which project it as their correlation key; these two record-audit
 *  entries simply do not read it. Two consequences a reader must not get wrong.
 *  A future entry here could project it with NO grant review and without tripping
 *  `undeclaredReadableColumns` — the grant already exists. And `tools/render.ts`
 *  identifies `requestId` as verbatim client header text, i.e. attacker-chosen
 *  free text, which is why the substrate had to add value quoting at all. Anyone
 *  tightening this allowlist must treat it as reach the role already has.
 *  So the AuditLog grant is NINE columns — AID-6A's eight plus `entityId`, which
 *  AID-6C added for the same purpose — and these two entries read eight of them.
 *  `membership-records.ts` states the same accounting for its own audit entry.
 *
 * THE PRESENCE-BOOLEAN TRAP, and it is the most important finding in this
 * module. `notes IS NOT NULL` needs the SELECT privilege on `notes`:
 * PostgreSQL's column privilege covers every reference to the column, not just a
 * projected one. So a `hasNotes` boolean cannot be had without granting the
 * SELECT-only role the ability to read every booking note in a `psql` session —
 * which would break the property this pack states plainly, that the withheld
 * columns "are not granted to the SELECT-only role at all, so PostgreSQL itself
 * refuses them (42501)". A boolean is not worth trading that for, so SIX
 * presence booleans that #2376's plan asked for are NOT projected here:
 * `hasNotes`, `hasAdminReviewNotes`, `hasMemberReviewJustification`,
 * `hasHostingReviewSnapshot` (entry 1), `hasLastConflictReason` and
 * `hasProposalSnapshot` (entry 4) — six names, and the count says six because an
 * earlier revision of this sentence said five while enumerating them all, in the
 * one place the rest of the tree redirects to. Every one of the six was dropped for
 * a GRANT reason and not for the 24-field cap: each needs SELECT on free text or
 * raw JSON (`Booking."notes"`, `"adminReviewNotes"`, `"memberReviewJustification"`,
 * `"adultMemberHostingReview"`, `BookingChangeRequest."lastConflictReason"`,
 * `"proposalSnapshot"`), so widening the cap recovers none of them.
 * Almost nothing is lost: `conflictCount > 0`
 * with `lastConflictAtUtc` already says a conflict happened, `requestKind =
 * POLICY_EXCEPTION` already implies a frozen proposal, and each entry's scope
 * line names the administration screen that shows the text itself.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE 24-FIELD CAP, AND WHAT IT COST
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `DIAGNOSTICS_TOOL_BOUNDS.maxFieldsPerRow` is 24 and it is ENFORCED, not
 * advisory: `projectRows` in `invoke.ts` throws `ProjectionContractError` on the
 * 25th field and the whole result is discarded as `redaction_failed`. `Booking`
 * carries 49 columns worth reporting. So the summary is a CHOSEN 24, and the
 * choice is written down here because a reader's first question will be why a
 * field they expected is absent.
 *
 * WHAT THE SUMMARY KEEPS, and the rule it was chosen by: a field is in if
 * leaving it out would let a model narrate something FALSE and ACTIONABLE about
 * a healthy booking.
 *   identity          bookingRef, bookingReference, ownerMemberRef, lodgeRef
 *   lifecycle         bookingStatus, deletedAtUtc, createdAtUtc, updatedAtUtc
 *   the nights        checkIn, checkOut, nightCount
 *   the party         guestCount, hasNonMembers, nonMemberHoldUntilUtc
 *   the money         totalPriceCents, discountCents, promoAdjustmentCents,
 *                     finalPriceCents, creditElectionCents
 *   the timers        draftExpiresAtUtc
 *   the links         parentBookingRef
 *   what blocks it    adminReviewStatus, hostingReviewStatus, wholeLodgeHold
 *
 * All five money columns stay TOGETHER on purpose. `total - discount - promo`
 * is what makes `final` explicable, and a model shown three of the four narrates
 * an unexplained gap as a defect. `wholeLodgeHold` stays because a booking with
 * sole occupancy changes every capacity answer for its nights, and a model that
 * cannot see it will confidently advise admitting somebody else.
 *
 * WHAT THE SUMMARY DROPPED, and where the evidence actually lives:
 *   lodgeName, waitlistPosition, requiresAdminReview, adminCapacityHoldAt,
 *   capacityOverriddenAt        → all on the `diagnostics.booking_search` row
 *                                 for the same booking (`kind: "booking_id"`),
 *                                 under the same `bookings:view` permission.
 *                                 Dropping `lodgeName` is also what makes the
 *                                 summary a PURE `Booking` read: no `Lodge`
 *                                 join, no `Lodge` grant, a smaller blast
 *                                 radius. It is the strongest reason of the set.
 *   waitlistOfferedAt, waitlistOfferExpiresAt, waitlistOfferedLodgeId,
 *   waitlistOfferedPriceCents   → dropped as a BLOCK, deliberately. A
 *                                 cross-lodge waitlist offer is an offer of a
 *                                 DIFFERENT lodge at a DIFFERENT price, so half
 *                                 the block ("the offer expires at X") would
 *                                 have a model describing an offer for the
 *                                 booking's own lodge. Half of this is worse
 *                                 than none of it; Admin > Waitlist is named in
 *                                 the scope line.
 *   expectedArrivalTime         → and the projection question is worth
 *                                 recording, because the obvious answer is
 *                                 wrong. It is a `VarChar(5)` like "18:30", and
 *                                 `stableCodeOrNull` would SENTINEL it:
 *                                 `PROJECTABLE_STABLE_CODE` is
 *                                 `/^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_.-]{0,47}$/`, which
 *                                 requires a leading LETTER. A colon is
 *                                 admitted but a leading digit is not. Had the
 *                                 field survived the cap it would have needed a
 *                                 local `/^\d{2}:\d{2}$/` validator returning
 *                                 the shared sentinel otherwise — never
 *                                 `stableCodeOrNull`, and never a bare
 *                                 pass-through, because the column is
 *                                 member-supplied and reaches the `key=value`
 *                                 evidence renderer.
 *   cancelIfGuestsBumped, organiserSettled, noEmails, preArrivalReminderSentAt,
 *   requestedRoomId, createdById → lowest-value flags and ids. Nothing else in
 *                                 the pack reads a requested room or an
 *                                 admin-creator, and the admin booking page
 *                                 shows all six.
 *   the six presence booleans   → see "the presence-boolean trap" above. Those
 *                                 are dropped for a GRANT reason, not a cap
 *                                 reason, and would stay dropped at any cap.
 *
 * A COMPOSED CODE LIST WAS CONSIDERED FOR THOSE FLAGS AND REJECTED, with the
 * measurement rather than a preference. `codeListOrNull` exists and AID-6A uses
 * one, so folding sixteen booleans into one comma-joined field was the obvious
 * way to buy the cap back. Measured: those sixteen codes join to 365 characters,
 * and `boundedScalar` in `invoke.ts` TRUNCATES a string over
 * `fieldValueMaxChars` (200) with an ellipsis rather than refusing it. A
 * truncated code list reads exactly like a complete one in which the missing
 * codes are not set — a silently FALSE and directly actionable claim about a
 * healthy booking, which is the failure this module is designed against. Every
 * shorter catalogue that carried the same facts came out between 187 and 209
 * characters, i.e. one added code away from the same defect. Named fields it is.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE BYTE AND BLOCK CEILINGS, measured
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Gate 9 REFUSES a result over the entry's `byteLimit`; it never trims one. The
 * multi-row entries here carry the pack's shared 16 384, and their row limits
 * are fixed in `booking-shared.ts`, so the only free variable is how WIDE a row
 * is — which is why two of these entries carry fewer fields than #2376's plan
 * asked for. THIS IS A MEASUREMENT, NOT AN ESTIMATE, and the measuring has to be
 * done with `canonicalStringify`, which PRETTY-PRINTS with a two-space indent:
 * every field costs its own line, so a field is worth about `key + value + 10`
 * bytes rather than `key + value`. An estimate that forgot the indentation came
 * out 30% low and would have shipped two entries whose full results gate 9
 * refuses outright.
 *
 *   entry                            fields  typical    widest  ceiling
 *   booking_diagnostic_summary        24 × 1    854 B         —   4 096
 *   booking_party_state               15 × 30  14.9 kB   18.0 kB  16 384
 *   booking_bed_allocation_state       8 × 60  wide result ceiling     24 576
 *   booking_exception_request_state    16 × 18  11.0 kB       —   16 384
 *   booking_record_audit_history        7 × 18   4.7 kB       —   16 384
 *
 * THE ALLOCATION ENTRY USES THE WIDE CEILING because its eighth field is the
 * canonical double-sharing verdict. Room and bed labels still go out through a
 * local 24-character validator instead of `personNameOrNull`'s 60; a real label
 * is "Bed 3". Gate 9 refuses rather than silently clipping an oversized result.
 *
 * THE PARTY ENTRY'S CEILING IS TYPICAL WITH A STATED BOUNDARY, because a name is
 * the evidence and capping a name the way a bed label is capped would be a worse
 * trade. Fifteen fields leave about 51 bytes a row spare, i.e. up to roughly
 * seventy characters of combined given-and-family name per guest across all
 * thirty. A party that exceeds that is REFUSED as `result_too_large` — an honest
 * refusal that names the booking page, never a silent clip — and this is why two
 * instants the plan asked for (the consent deadline and the arrival instant) are
 * not projected.
 *
 * THE RENDERED BLOCK IS A SEPARATE, SMALLER CEILING —
 * `renderedBlockMaxChars` is 8 000 — and three of these entries cannot list a
 * FULL result inside it. That is inherent to the row limits and it is handled
 * HONESTLY rather than hidden: `render.ts` drops whole rows from the tail and
 * relabels the header `rows (N of M listed — the rest did not fit this block, so
 * this listing is incomplete)`, and the evidence state becomes
 * `result_truncated`. No row is ever cut mid-field.
 *
 * Measured at typical widths, with each entry's own scope line in the block: the
 * summary lists its 1 row in 4 092 characters, the audit history lists all 18 in
 * 6 766, the allocation entry lists 23 of 60, the exception entry 7 of 18, and
 * the party entry 6 of 30. The party entry is the worst because its scope carries
 * the whole consent vocabulary, and that trade was made deliberately: a
 * `consentSubState` code the model cannot interpret is worse than three more rows
 * it can, and real parties are three to eight guests, so the clip is a
 * whole-lodge school-group phenomenon rather than the normal case. Each affected
 * scope line names the administration screen that shows the whole set.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TWO PLACES WHERE #2376's PLAN DISAGREED WITH THE SCHEMA
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  1. MEMBER-GUEST CONSENT IS LIVE, NOT INERT. The plan for this module said the
 *     consent columns are inert because `MEMBER_GUEST_WIDENING_ENABLED === false`
 *     in `member-guest-consent.ts`, and that a NULL therefore always means "no
 *     consent was ever needed". THAT CONSTANT NO LONGER EXISTS. MG2 (#2307)
 *     landed: `member-guest-consent.ts` writes `consentStatus: "PENDING"` and
 *     `"CONFIRMED"` through `buildMemberGuestConsentWrite`,
 *     `member-guest-consent-service.ts` resolves them,
 *     `admin-bookings-service.ts` filters an officer queue on `PENDING`, and
 *     `cron-member-guest-consent-expiry.ts` sweeps the lapsed ones. Its own
 *     `member-guest-widening.test.ts` records that MG1's assertion of the
 *     constant "has done its job and is gone", and the widening is now a
 *     per-club module read that FAILS CLOSED per call site. The scope line
 *     therefore states the property that is actually true — NULL is the
 *     DOMINANT value forever and means "no consent was ever needed" — and never
 *     the stale claim that no row can carry a status. Writing the stale version
 *     would have been the exact failure mode this module is designed against:
 *     a confident, actionable falsehood about a healthy record. (The schema's
 *     own comment on `BookingGuest.consentStatus` is stale in the same way.)
 *
 *  2. FIVE CONSENT COLUMNS ARE FOLDED INTO TWO DERIVED FIELDS. The schema's
 *     `MEMBER_GUEST_CONSENT_SUB_STATES` table is the platform's own source of
 *     truth for which combination means what, so the projection calls its
 *     canonical classifier and emits one `consentSubState`
 *     code from a closed server-owned catalogue, interpolated into the scope line
 *     so the vocabulary actually reaches the model. Alongside it goes
 *     `operationallyPresent` — the platform's OWN predicate
 *     (`OPERATIONALLY_PRESENT_GUEST_WHERE`) evaluated server-side, so a model
 *     never has to build it and can never build it wrongly. Two fields instead
 *     of four, the eight documented shapes distinguishable from seven codes, and
 *     `consentRespondedByMemberId` is compared only to the target id and is never
 *     emitted; target and delegate approvals intentionally share one public code.
 *     The raw `consentStatus` is
 *     not projected alongside the code deliberately: the code NAMES the null case
 *     (`family_or_legacy`), so the dominant value a model is most likely to
 *     misread as "consent outstanding" is no longer a null it has to interpret.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * PROPERTIES, STATED AS PROPERTIES OF THE CODE
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  - EVERY ENTRY TAKES A REQUIRED EXACT BOOKING ID. `{}` does not parse for any
 *    of the five: the schema is `z.object({ bookingId: RECORD_ID }).strict()`
 *    with no optional member and no default.
 *  - NO PATTERN LANGUAGE ANYWHERE. Every predicate is `=` or `= ANY(...)`.
 *    There is no `LIKE`, no `ILIKE`, no `SIMILAR TO`, no regex operator and no
 *    wildcard character in any statement in this module, so nothing a caller can
 *    send has anything to mean beyond a literal.
 *  - ONE FIXED STATEMENT PER ENTRY, no semicolon, `public."Relation"` qualified,
 *    `pg_catalog.` functions, and `bind` returns EXACTLY the parameters the
 *    statement references. The executor appends the row cap as `$N+1` and
 *    refuses an arity mismatch before it opens a connection, because a short
 *    `bind` would silently alias the row cap onto a predicate.
 *  - TOTAL `ORDER BY` ON EVERY MULTI-ROW ENTRY, always ending in the row's own
 *    id, so identical evidence hashes identically for the audit trail.
 *  - NO JOIN CAN DROP A ROW. Every join to a lookup relation is a LEFT JOIN and
 *    the one aggregate join is a `CROSS JOIN LATERAL` over an ungrouped
 *    aggregate, which returns exactly one row for every left row. A booking's
 *    guest whose bed row had a broken foreign key would still be listed, with
 *    nulls, rather than vanishing from the answer — an omitted guest-night is
 *    the falsehood that matters here.
 *  - NULL, 0 AND ABSENT STAY DIFFERENT. `centsOrZero` is used only where the
 *    schema says `@default(0)`; `centsOrNull` everywhere else, so an amount that
 *    did not arrive as an integer is reported as unknown rather than as nothing
 *    owed. Two booleans that can be genuinely UNKNOWN — a guest with no
 *    per-night rows, and a bed row whose bed could not be read — go out through
 *    `nullableBoolOf` and stay null rather than collapsing to `false`.
 *
 * The pack doc is `docs/ai-diagnostics/tool-pack-booking-membership.md`.

 * here.
 *
 * A PURE `Booking` READ, plus one scalar subquery for the party size. There is
 * no `Lodge` join — `lodgeName` was dropped, and that is what keeps this
 * statement's grant to a single relation.
 *
 * `nightCount` IS A DATE SUBTRACTION AND THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT.
 * `checkOut - checkIn` on two `date` columns is an `integer` number of days, and
 * because `checkOut` is the departure day rather than a night, that integer IS
 * the number of lodge nights: the 14th to the 17th is three nights. It is
 * computed in SQL rather than in the projection for the reason this pack refuses
 * to touch a lodge night in JavaScript at all — the moment a `@db.Date` becomes
 * a `Date` object it acquires a timezone it did not have, and a night that
 * shifts by twelve hours is a different night.
 *
 * `creditElectionCents` HAS THREE STATES AND KEEPS THEM. The schema is explicit:
 * NULL means no election is outstanding (never made, or already consumed), 0
 * means the member explicitly chose to use NONE, and a positive value is the
 * amount they asked to apply. It goes out through `centsOrNull`, so a NULL never
 * becomes a 0 — a model shown 0 says "none", which is a different and more
 * confident claim than "nothing is recorded". It is NOT a record of credit
 * already applied; the applied total lives in the `MemberCredit` ledger, which
 * is finance evidence this pack cannot read, and the scope line says so.
 *
 * `totalPriceCents` and `finalPriceCents` use `centsOrNull` rather than
 * `centsOrZero`, DELIBERATELY DIVERGING from the two LISTING entries that project
 * the same column — `booking_search` (`booking-search.ts`) and
 * `member_booking_summary` (`membership-records.ts`) — both of which coerce
 * `finalPriceCents` to zero. Three entries, two helpers, and the split is by the
 * kind of answer rather than by module.
 *
 * Both columns are `Int` NOT NULL with no `@default`, so an absent value is
 * impossible either way and the divergence is unreachable on real data. It is
 * about which wrong answer is safer if it ever becomes reachable. THIS entry is
 * the per-booking money answer an officer acts on, so an unexpected read must say
 * "unknown": reporting a booking as costing nothing is worse in every direction.
 * The listing entries exist for RECOGNITION — pick the right booking out of ten —
 * where a `null` in a price column beside nine numbers reads as a data fault in
 * the tool and sends the reader to the wrong question; they hold a number, and the
 * entry an operator drills into carries the honest absence.

/**
 * The closed, server-owned catalogue that turns a `BookingGuest`'s five consent
 * columns into ONE stable code — and the sentences that tell a model what each
 * code means, interpolated into the entry's own `evidenceScope` so the
 * vocabulary actually reaches the consumer.
 *
 * AID-6C's review found a catalogue in the finance pack that existed and was
 * read only by its own test. A code the model cannot interpret is worse than no
 * code: it invites a guess. So this object is the single source of both the SQL
 * literals and the model-facing explanation, and neither can drift from the
 * other because the statement is built from these keys.
 *
 * THE SHAPES ARE THE PLATFORM'S OWN, NOT THIS MODULE'S INVENTION. The schema
 * comment on `BookingGuest.consentStatus` carries an eight-row discriminator
 * table generated from `MEMBER_GUEST_CONSENT_SUB_STATES` in
 * `member-guest-consent.ts`, and `member-guest-consent.test.ts` fails unless the
 * comment matches it verbatim. Seven codes cover the eight shapes: TARGET_APPROVED
 * and DELEGATE_APPROVED are told apart only by whether `consentRespondedByMemberId`
 * is the guest themself, and that column names a person, so the two share
 * `approved_on_request` and this catalogue says so rather than picking one.
 *
 * THE COLUMN IS GRANTED AND READ — say so, because an earlier revision of this
 * sentence said it was "NOT granted" and that is a trap in both directions. It is
 * in the `BookingGuest` allowlist in `provision-role.ts`, this module's own grant
 * table lists it among the five consent discriminators "READ BUT NEVER PROJECTED",
 * `BOOKING_PARTY_SQL` selects it, and `consentSubStateOf` passes it into
 * `classifyMemberGuestConsent` — which cannot classify a CONFIRMED row without it
 * (it returns null, mapped to `unrecognised_consent_shape`, when the responder is
 * absent). A reader who believed the "NOT granted" line and tightened the
 * allowlist would take the grant away and break `booking_party_state` with a 42501
 * for EVERY booking, because a column privilege covers a SELECT-list reference. A
 * reader going the other way would think reporting WHICH of the two approved it
 * needs a fresh grant, and widen disclosure on a false premise. What withholds the
 * responder is the PROJECTION, not the server: the id is compared to the target id
 * and never emitted — the same thing this module says correctly in its grant table.

/**
 * ONE ROW PER GUEST on the booking, with the per-night facts that make the

 *
 * `stayStart`/`stayEnd` ARE THE HALF-OPEN ENVELOPE: stayStart is inclusive and
 * stayEnd is the exclusive departure day, NEVER the last occupied night.
 * `firstNight`/`lastNight` ARE THE EXPLICIT NIGHT FACTS, and both representations
 * are projected because either alone is a trap. A guest may stay
 * NON-CONTIGUOUS nights within one booking (issue #713): each included night is
 * a `BookingGuestNight` row and the envelope is only the min/max of that set,
 * kept in sync on every write. So the envelope alone would have a model
 * narrating a gap-free stay over a gap. The per-night rows alone would be worse
 * for the opposite reason: a guest with NO per-night rows would report
 * `nightCount = 0` with null first and last nights, and a model would say the
 * guest is staying no nights — while the envelope says the 14th to the 17th.
 * Both, plus an explicit contiguity flag, is the only combination that cannot
 * produce a confident falsehood.
 *
 * `nightsAreContiguous` IS THREE-VALUED, and it is computed from the per-night
 * rows rather than from the envelope. True means the night count equals the span
 * from first to last night inclusive, so there is no gap. False means there IS a
 * gap. NULL means there are no per-night rows at all, so contiguity is not
 * established — which is a different answer from "there are gaps", and a
 * `false` there would be a specific and possibly untrue claim.
 *
 * `operationallyPresent` IS THE PLATFORM'S OWN PREDICATE, evaluated in SQL.
 * `OPERATIONALLY_PRESENT_GUEST_WHERE` in `member-guest-consent.ts` is
 * `consentStatus IS NULL OR consentStatus = 'CONFIRMED'`, and it is what the
 * kiosk, the chore roster, bed allocation, the arrival emails and the lodge
 * board all filter on. Precomputing it means a model never has to assemble it —
 * and cannot assemble it wrongly. The wrong way is spelled out in the schema and
 * in `member-guest-consent.ts` as a trap: `consentStatus <> 'PENDING'` is
 * UNKNOWN for a NULL row, and NULL is the dominant value forever, so that filter
 * silently drops every ordinary guest.
 *
 * The `CROSS JOIN LATERAL` cannot drop a guest: an aggregate query with no
 * `GROUP BY` returns exactly one row, so the derived table is total over the

/**
 * ONE ROW PER `BedAllocation` — one guest, one bed, one night — for THIS booking
 * only.
 *
 * EIGHT FIELDS. A guest-night is a row, so this is a party times a stay: six
 * guests over ten nights is sixty rows. The eighth is a stable verdict from the
 * canonical double-sharing rule, and the entry therefore uses the pack's 24 576
 * byte wide ceiling. Labels remain capped at 24 characters and gate 9 refuses an
 * oversized full result rather than silently trimming it.
 * Dropped to get here, in the order they were given up: the allocation's own id
 * (the row has a natural key — see below), the room and bed ids, the live bed
 * type (the comparison carries it), the bunk group, the approval instant, the
 * created instant, the allocation source and the bed's active flag. Each is named
 * in the scope line with the board that shows it.
 *
 * NO EVIDENCE REFERENCE IS PROJECTED, AND IT IS NOT NEEDED. Every other
 * per-record entry in both packs projects the row's own id, and dropping it here
 * bought forty bytes a row on the tightest entry in the pack. It costs nothing
 * because the row has a NATURAL key that IS projected: the schema's
 * `@@unique([bookingGuestId, stayDate])` means one guest has at most one
 * allocation per night, so guest plus night identifies the row exactly. The id
 * is still the final `ORDER BY` term, so the ordering stays total and the audit
 * `resultHash` stays stable.
 *
 * BOTH BED TYPES ARE COMPARED AND ONE IS REPORTED, which is the resolution of a
 * real conflict. `BedAllocation."bedType"` is a DENORMALISED copy of
 * `LodgeBed."bedType"`, taken at allocation time, and it is the copy the
 * partial unique index actually enforces on: the index predicate cannot join to
 * `LodgeBed`, so the "non-double beds are capped at one occupant a night" guard
 * reads the row's own column. A mismatch between the two is therefore a real
 * defect with real consequences, and reporting only one of them would hide it.
 * `bedType` is the denormalised copy — the one the index guard uses — and
 * `bedTypeMatchesBed` is the comparison. The live type is not projected
 * separately, but it IS the authoritative input to `doubleBedSharingState`: a
 * stale allocation copy must never decide current sharing eligibility. When the
 * values match they are the same; when they do not, the mismatch plus the live
 * verdict is the finding and the bed-allocation board shows the current bed.
 * The comparison is NULL when the bed row could not be read at all, and the
 * sharing verdict then says `live_bed_missing` rather than inventing a type.
 *
 * EVERY JOIN IS A LEFT JOIN so a broken foreign key cannot silently remove a
 * guest-night from the answer. The room and bed relations are `Restrict` with
 * NOT NULL columns, so a null room or bed label is itself a finding rather than
 * an ordinary absence — and an inner join would have turned that finding into a
 * missing row, which is the falsehood that matters here. The bed join uses BOTH
 * columns of the composite foreign key (`[bedId, roomId]` → `[id, roomId]`),
 * exactly as the schema declares it.
 *
 * `bedType` IS STILL PROJECTED EVEN THOUGH THE BED IS ONLY REACHED FOR ITS NAME
 * AND THE COMPARISON, and that is not redundancy: the projected value is the
 * ALLOCATION's own copy, which is the one the guard reads, so it is the value
 * that explains why a second occupant was accepted or refused.

Second, "Booking" is the ONLY entity type read here: an event recorded against this booking's PAYMENT, its bed allocation, its change request or the member is filed under that record's own type and id, and is not in this result. Never report that something did not happen on the strength of an empty result; say that no categorised booking audit event matched the booking record, and point at Admin > Audit Log, which lists historical uncategorised rows and every entity type as well. ${AID6B_SCOPE_TAIL} ${AID6B_UNTRUSTED_EVIDENCE_DISCLOSURE}`,
