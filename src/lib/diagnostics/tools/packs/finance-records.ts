/**
 * AI Diagnostics — AID-6C finance pack, part 2: PER-RECORD STORED EVIDENCE
 * (#2377, epic #2369).
 *
 * Seven entries, each taking an EXACT identifier that `finance-search.ts` had to
 * produce first. There is no listing tool here, no window that returns "recent
 * payments", and no argument that widens a predicate — so the pack has no shape
 * that could be walked to extract a ledger.
 *
 *   diagnostics.payment_diagnostic_summary     finance
 *   diagnostics.payment_attempt_ledger         finance
 *   diagnostics.payment_refund_state           finance
 *   diagnostics.finance_webhook_timeline       finance
 *   diagnostics.xero_invoice_linkage           finance
 *   diagnostics.xero_contact_linkage           finance + membership
 *   diagnostics.finance_record_audit_history   finance
 *
 * PERMISSION, and the one line that decides it. `finance:view` is the area that
 * already governs Admin > Payments, Refund Appeals, Internet Banking and Xero
 * Sync. It is required, and — for six of the seven — it is ALL that is required:
 * #2375's owner decision is explicit that a domain tool must not also demand
 * `support:view`, and a Finance Officer investigating a payment is doing their
 * own job, not a support one.
 *
 * `diagnostics.xero_contact_linkage` is the exception and it is deliberate. It is
 * keyed on a MEMBER, and the epic's rule for a tool that combines finance and
 * membership evidence is that it requires both areas, AND-ed. Tying a member to a
 * Xero contact is exactly that combination, so it declares `finance` and
 * `membership` and the executor re-reads both on every invocation. There is no
 * argument that could move an entry between the two permission sets: the areas
 * are fixed on the entry, and `invoke.ts` authorizes before it parses arguments.
 *
 * STORED EVIDENCE ONLY. Nothing in this module calls Stripe, Xero, a bank or any
 * other provider. Every provider value is what this platform last WROTE DOWN, and
 * every entry says so in its own scope line, because the difference between "the
 * stored Stripe state is SUCCEEDED" and "Stripe says this succeeded" is the whole
 * difference between evidence and a claim the pack is not entitled to make.
 *
 * FOUR CLASSES OF COLUMN ARE NEVER READ, and they are not merely unprojected —
 * with the exceptions argued below they are outside the SELECT grant, so
 * PostgreSQL refuses them (42501) to this credential in a `psql` session as
 * readily as in a tool:
 *
 *  1. RAW PROVIDER PAYLOADS. `XeroInboundEvent."payload"` is the only column in
 *     this schema that stores a raw provider webhook body, and it is the single
 *     most important omission in the pack. `XeroSyncOperation."requestPayload"`
 *     and `"responsePayload"` are the raw Xero request/response bodies. None is
 *     granted.
 *  2. RAW PROVIDER OR HANDLER ERROR TEXT. `PaymentRecoveryOperation."lastError"`
 *     (`@db.Text`, routinely a stack), `XeroSyncOperation."lastErrorMessage"`,
 *     `XeroInboundEvent."errorMessage"`, `WebhookLog."error"`. The pack reports
 *     `XeroSyncOperation."lastErrorCode"` — a stable code — and nothing else.
 *  3. OPERATOR AND MEMBER FREE TEXT. `Payment."manualPaymentNote"`,
 *     `ManualRefundTask."reason"`/`"note"`, `RefundRequest."reason"`/
 *     `"adminNotes"`, `PaymentTransaction."reason"`,
 *     `XeroSyncOperation."manuallyResolvedReason"`, `MemberCredit."description"`.
 *     One free-text value IS projected — the internet-banking reference — and it
 *     is bounded to 64 characters and stripped, because it is the only way to
 *     match a bank line to a booking and #2377 lists it as approved evidence.
 *  4. PEOPLE. No member name, email address, phone number or member id reaches a
 *     projected row from any entry here except `xero_contact_linkage`, which
 *     projects the member id it was GIVEN and requires `membership:view` to run.
 *     `Payment."manuallyMarkedPaidByMemberId"`, `ManualRefundTask.`
 *     `"completedByMemberId"`, `RefundRequest."memberId"`/`"reviewedBy"`,
 *     `XeroSyncOperation."createdByMemberId"`/`"manuallyResolvedById"` and
 *     `AuditLog."actorMemberId"`/`"subjectMemberId"`/`"memberId"` are all
 *     ungranted.
 *
 * ONE COLUMN IS GRANTED SO THAT IT NEVER HAS TO BE PROJECTED, and it is worth
 * calling out because it is the pattern #2377 asks for by name.
 * `PaymentRecoveryOperation."idempotencyKey"` is the ONLY thing that says WHY a
 * refund was queued — the operation `type` is `REFUND_BOOKING_MODIFICATION` for a
 * cancellation refund, a refund-appeal refund, a capacity-race refund and a
 * duplicate-capture refund alike, so a tool that reported the type alone would
 * mislabel every one of them. The key's PREFIX is a server-written scenario
 * marker. So the statement classifies it against a closed list of prefixes from
 * this repository's own `payment-recovery-keys.ts` and projects the resulting
 * CODE; the key itself never leaves the database. That is "map the stable code
 * through a server-owned catalogue" implemented one layer lower than usual, and
 * it means a future projection bug cannot leak the key either.
 *
 * NO WILDCARD REACHES SQL. `pg_catalog.starts_with` is used for the prefix
 * classification above, with literals this module owns; there is no `LIKE`, no
 * `ILIKE` and no regex operator anywhere in the pack, and no caller-supplied
 * value is ever used as a pattern. Every caller-supplied value is an equality
 * against an indexed column.

/**
 * ONE ROW: everything this platform has written down about one booking payment.
 *
 * Every amount here is an `Int` column in PostgreSQL — integer cents, checked on
 * the way out by `centsOrZero`, which returns null rather than a rounded number
 * if a non-integer ever arrives. There is no currency column on `Payment`: this
 * platform is single-currency NZD, and inventing a currency field here would be
 * asserting something the database does not record. The scope line says so, and
 * `payment_refund_state` DOES project the per-refund `currency` column, which is
 * the one place a currency really is stored.
 *
 * WHAT IS PROJECTED AND WHY IT IS SAFE:
 *  - the payment and booking ids, and the eight-character booking reference an
 *    operator reads off a confirmation email;
 *  - the closed `PaymentStatus` and `PaymentSource` enums;
 *  - the five money columns, in cents;
 *  - the stored Stripe PaymentIntent ids (primary and additional). #2377 lists
 *    stored Stripe references as approved evidence, and a PaymentIntent id is
 *    what a Finance Officer types into the Stripe dashboard. The Stripe CUSTOMER
 *    and PAYMENT METHOD ids are NOT projected and NOT granted — they identify the
 *    stored instrument rather than this transaction, and no diagnostic question
 *    needs them;
 *  - the stored Xero invoice id, invoice number and refund credit-note id;
 *  - the internet-banking reference, bounded and stripped;
 *  - the internet-banking hold state, which is what decides whether a bed is
 *    still being held for an unpaid bank transfer;
 *  - whether the payment was settled BY HAND, which is the single most
 *    misread fact in this domain: a manually marked-paid row is an ordinary
 *    `INTERNET_BANKING` payment with no Stripe leg, so "refund it" means "hand the
 *    money back", not "click refund".

 *  - `refund_appeal` (`RefundRequest`) — the MEMBER asked. `PENDING` means nobody

 *  - `refund_execution` (`PaymentRecoveryOperation`, refund types only) — the
 *    platform's undertaking to execute a refund at Stripe. `PENDING`/`PROCESSING`
 *    is money that has NOT moved yet; `FAILED` at five attempts is exhausted.
 *  - `stripe_refund` (`PaymentRefund`) — the immutable ledger of a refund Stripe
 *    actually performed, with its own id, amount, CURRENCY and Stripe status.
 *    This is the only relation in the pack that stores a currency.
 *  - `manual_refund_task` (`ManualRefundTask`) — money that must be handed back
 *    BY A HUMAN because there is no card to refund (a cash or bank-transfer
 *    settlement). `OPEN` means somebody still owes the member money.
 *
 * A model that collapses these will tell a Finance Officer a refund is done when
 * a member has merely asked for one, or that one is pending when the platform has
 * already paid it. So the `entryKind` is projected on every row, each arm's own
 * status vocabulary is preserved rather than normalised into a common one, and
 * the description spells the four apart.
 *
 * `RefundRequest` is reached through the payment's own `bookingId` rather than
 * being keyed separately, so the whole answer still hangs off one exact payment
 * id and there is still no way to list refunds across bookings.

/**
 * THREE LEDGERS, and the reason all three are needed to answer one question.
 *
 *  - `ProcessedWebhookEvent` is the idempotency LEASE, one row per
 *    (provider, event id). `PROCESSING` means a handler took the lease and has
 *    not finished — a `PROCESSING` row much older than the lease window is a
 *    crashed attempt, which is what "the webhook arrived and nothing happened"
 *    actually looks like. It carries no attempt COUNTER, and this pack does not
 *    invent one: `WebhookLog` rows are the redelivery evidence.
 *  - `WebhookLog` is the delivery log, one row per delivery ATTEMPT with a
 *    success/failure outcome and a duration. SEVERAL rows for one event id is a
 *    provider redelivery — which is what a duplicate event looks like — and their
 *    order is what an out-of-order delivery looks like. Its `error` column is raw
 *    handler text and is neither granted nor projected.
 *  - `XeroInboundEvent` is Xero's own inbound ledger, matched on the Xero
 *    RESOURCE id or the correlation key, so an operator holding a Xero invoice id
 *    can ask what arrived for it. Its `payload` column is the only raw provider
 *    body in this schema and is not granted.
 *
 * MISSING IS AN ANSWER TOO. An empty result means no webhook was recorded for
 * that reference at all, which — for a payment that Stripe says succeeded — is
 * the finding, not a failure of the tool. The scope line says so, because
 * `not_found` alone would read as "there is nothing to report".
 *
 * THE LEASE ARM'S ENTRY REFERENCE IS ITS EVENT ID, NOT ITS SURROGATE KEY.
 * `ProcessedWebhookEvent."id"` is not granted: the row's identity is its
 * `(source, eventId)` unique constraint, both halves of which this statement
 * filters to one value, so the arm contributes at most one row and the ordering
 * stays total without it. Leaving the surrogate ungranted also keeps every
 * column-granted relation in the allowlist strictly narrower than its table,
 * which is the property the real-PostgreSQL proof asserts relation by relation.

/**
 * The record kinds an operator can ask for the finance audit history of, and the
 * `AuditLog."entityType"` values each one really means.
 *
 * THE ARGUMENT IS A NORMALISED DOMAIN WORD, never the raw column value: `bind`
 * closes over the server-owned array of column values each word covers, so the
 * model cannot name a column value at all and the mapping is reviewable in one
 * place.
 *
 * FOUR SUBJECTS WERE REMOVED HERE AND THE REASON MATTERS (#2377 review). An
 * earlier revision listed `xero_invoice → ["INVOICE"]`, `xero_contact →
 * ["CONTACT"]` and `xero_allocation → ["ALLOCATION"]`, and paired `"PAYMENT"`
 * with `"Payment"` and `"SUBSCRIPTION"` with `"MemberSubscription"`, on the
 * stated theory that this platform's audit writers use two casings. THEY DO NOT.
 * Every uppercase value of that shape in this tree is an argument to
 * `startXeroSyncOperation`, which writes `XeroSyncOperation."entityType"` — a
 * DIFFERENT relation that this entry does not query and is not granted. Every
 * real `AuditLog."entityType"` writer uses PascalCase. So those three subjects
 * could only ever return zero rows, and an empty result from a tool whose own
 * scope line says "nothing matching means nothing in THOSE categories matched"
 * is worse than no tool: it reads as evidence of absence.
 *
 * Xero sync history has a real home already — `diagnostics.xero_invoice_linkage`
 * and `diagnostics.xero_contact_linkage` read `XeroSyncOperation` directly, with
 * status, attempt count and a stable error code. Pointing an operator there is
 * the honest answer, and the entry's description says so.
 *
 * A SECOND REASON those three could not have worked: `RECORD_ID` accepts a
 * lowercase-alphanumeric cuid, and a Xero object id is a hyphenated GUID. The
 * argument shape could not express the id the subject needed.

/**
 * PER-RECORD finance audit history — the thing AID-6A deliberately could not do.
 *
 * AID-6A granted eight columns of `AuditLog` and pointedly withheld `entityId`,
 * recording in its own pack doc that "per-record evidence — the member, the
 * booking, the payment — is AID-6B and AID-6C work, under their own area
 * permission and their own privacy review". This is that review, and its outcome
 * is: `entityId` is added to the column grant, and this is the only entry that
 * uses it.
 *
 * WHAT THAT DOES AND DOES NOT WIDEN. `entityId` is the id of the record an event
 * concerned; for the seven subjects above it is a payment, booking, invoice,
 * contact, allocation, task or subscription id. It is used here as a PREDICATE
 * against an id the caller already supplied — so the tool discloses which events
 * touched a record the operator is already looking at, and never enumerates. It
 * is NOT projected: the row carries the audit row's own id as its evidence
 * reference, and echoing the caller's own argument back on every row would only
 * spend the entry's byte ceiling.
 *
 * The three member-identifying columns (`memberId`, `actorMemberId`,
 * `subjectMemberId`), the free text (`summary`, `details`), the arbitrary
 * `metadata` JSON, and `ipAddress`/`userAgent` all remain ungranted, exactly as
 * AID-6A left them. So this entry can say that a refund event occurred on this
 * payment, at this instant, with this outcome — and cannot say who did it, from
 * where, or what they typed.
 *
 * THE CATEGORY FILTER IS THE PERMISSION BOUNDARY, and it carries AID-6A's
 * disclosure with it: an audit row written with NO category is matched by nothing
 * here. #2581's second child classified all 82 previously-uncategorised write
 * sites at the source, so the census now reads 462 write sites and ZERO
 * uncategorised (`scripts/audit/audit-writer-census-manifest.ts`, pinned by
 * `src/lib/__tests__/audit-writer-census.test.ts`) and no NEW row is born
 * invisible here. The gap has stopped growing, not closed: every row written
 * before that runtime deployed still carries `category = NULL`, including
 * money-adjacent ones (subscription billing, member-credit adjustments, fee
 * configuration, Xero settings and retries), and the historical backfill is
 * #2581's third child, outstanding. So an empty result here is still not
 * evidence that nothing happened, and the scope line says so in as many words.
