/**
 * Group bookings (shareable join code).
 *
 * A member (the organiser) opens one of their own bookings as a private group
 * event and shares a short join code. Members and non-members open the
 * /join/[code] link and add themselves: each joiner becomes their own child
 * Booking linked to the organiser booking via Booking.parentBookingId (the
 * existing split-booking relation), so capacity, pricing, payment, and
 * cancellation all reuse the per-booking machinery.
 *
 * The organiser chooses, per group, whether each joiner pays for their own beds
 * (EACH_PAYS_OWN) or the organiser settles the whole bill and joiners are
 * registered at $0 (ORGANISER_PAYS). Joins are checked against remaining lodge
 * capacity at join time under the same advisory lock as every other creation
 * path; there is no pre-held block.
 *
 * Conventions (matching booking-request.ts):
 *   - money stays integer cents
 *   - booking dates stay NZ date-only values
 *   - only SHA-256 token hashes are stored (issueActionToken)
 *   - external calls (email) run after the transaction commits
 *
 * This module owns code generation, organiser create/manage, and public code
 * lookup. The join orchestration (member join, non-member verify, child booking
 * creation) builds on these in the route layer.
