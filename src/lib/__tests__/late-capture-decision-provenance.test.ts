/**
 * #2773 / #2774 — the provenance guard.
 *
 * WHY A TEST AND NOT A REVIEW NOTE. Two independent review lenses found the same
 * defect on this branch: **eighteen** places in code and in **permanent invariant
 * documents** recorded the #2773 / #2774 directions as a settled "owner decision
 * 11 Aug 2026", while both issues carried `needs-decision`, one comment (the owner
 * holding the branch over exactly this), zero ticked options and no assignee. That
 * is not a wording nicety. `CLAUDE.md` makes the issue thread the audit trail,
 * `docs/DOMAIN_INVARIANTS.md` is mandatory reading, and `INV-ADDPAY-039`
 * **withholds a member's refund** — so a false "owner decided" clause in it would
 * tell every future agent that the semantics are settled and must not be revisited.
 * The attribution outlives the branch; prose alone would let it come back on the
 * next edit. The authority line under `INV-ADDPAY-039` is the single source for the
 * count and for the incident itself; if the two ever disagree, that one is right.
 *
 * WHAT IT PINS, in both directions:
 *
 * 1. **No source or document claims an owner decision for #2773 or #2774.** The
 *    scan is over every file listed below, which half 4 proves is every file in the
 *    tree that cites either issue — so re-adding a claim fails here by name rather
 *    than in a reviewer's head.
 * 2. **The true attribution is actually stated** where a reader lands: the
 *    authority line under `INV-ADDPAY-039`, the index rows in
 *    `docs/DOMAIN_INVARIANTS.md` for all three affected invariants, and the shared
 *    epilogue's module docblock. A silent strip would satisfy (1) while leaving the
 *    next reader to assume the same thing, so both halves are required.
 * 3. **The TRUE #2700 / #2750 / #2760 / #2761 citations are still there.** Deleting
 *    a real owner decision to make a scan pass is the same failure pointing the
 *    other way, and it is the obvious wrong way to fix a failure of (1). Those four
 *    threads each carry the owner's own dated comment; #2773 and #2774 do not.
 * 4. **The file list cannot fall behind the tree.** The gap that survived the first
 *    correction pass was not a missing pattern — it was five files nobody added to
 *    the list, including a routed document that still said "#2774 D1 settled". So
 *    the list is checked for completeness rather than trusted.
 *
 * MUTATION PROOF, re-run after every change here. Restore an "owner decision 11 Aug
 * 2026" clause — on one line OR wrapped across two, in a source file or a test
 * comment — and (1) fails naming the file and the sentence. Delete an authority
 * line, an index row's attribution, or the module docblock and (2) fails. Strip any
 * real 10 Aug citation and (3) fails. Add a new file citing either issue without
 * listing it and (4) fails.
 *
 * WHY THE SCAN IS WHITESPACE-COLLAPSED. It used to be per line, and these sentences
 * wrap: the branch's own TRUE citations already wrap ("(#2761, owner\ndecision 10
 * Aug 2026"), because at 80 columns an eight-word citation lands on a line break as
 * a matter of course. A per-line scan therefore missed the ordinary outcome of a
 * future author re-adding a claim and reflowing the paragraph — not an attack, just
 * the next edit. Matching a collapsed copy of the file and mapping the offset back
 * to a line number costs nothing and removes the whole class.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT ASSERT THE DECISION IS ABSENT FOREVER. When the owner rules on #2773
 * and #2774 and the answer is on the issue threads, this test is what has to be
 * updated deliberately — pointing at the recorded comment — which is the intended
 * cost of claiming owner authority. Note that the fabricated date, 11 Aug 2026, is
 * a real date on which a real ruling could land: a genuine one still means editing
 * this file on purpose, with the comment link in hand.
