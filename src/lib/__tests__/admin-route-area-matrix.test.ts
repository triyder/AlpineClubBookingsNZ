// Admin route -> area matrix pin (issue #1548).
//
// The sibling admin-route-map-drift.test.ts guards ONE failure mode: a new
// /api/admin route that silently lands on the `overview` catch-all. It cannot
// catch a route that is MIS-mapped onto an existing, wrong prefix (a new
// finance action added under /api/admin/members/[id]/... inherits `membership`
// and passes there).
//
// This test closes that gap by pinning the COMPLETE route -> area assignment.
// It walks every /api/admin/**/route.ts, resolves each through the REAL
// getAdminRouteRequirement(), and asserts the full map equals a frozen snapshot
// (EXPECTED_ROUTE_AREAS). Any prefix edit, new route, or reshuffle that changes
// an area shows up as a precise diff, so remapping the effective access of every
// deployed custom role cannot happen unnoticed.
//
// The snapshot is CURRENT truth, derived from the resolver over the working
// tree — not aspirational. When it fails, do NOT blindly repaste: confirm the
// new/changed route's area is the one you intend (a wrong prefix silently
// widens or narrows access), then update EXPECTED_ROUTE_AREAS to match.
