// tested elsewhere; this is the value-level assertion the production-readiness
// review found missing: two lodges with DIFFERENT active season rates for the
// SAME date and age tier must each resolve THEIR OWN price. Booking pricing is
// pure over the season rows it is given (booking-create.ts scopes the
// season.findMany by lodge via lodgeNullTolerantScope, then feeds the rows into
// these functions), so exercising the pricing functions with each lodge's own
// scoped rows proves the money value is lodge-specific.

// Same season window and identical age tiers at both lodges; only the
// pricePerNightCents differs, so any leakage between lodges would surface as a
// wrong dollar figure rather than a scoping error.
