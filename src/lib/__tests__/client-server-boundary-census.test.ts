 * INV-OPS-013, with transitive reach (#2686).
 *
 * `.semgrep/rules/acb-client-server-boundary.yml` reports a `"use client"`
 * module that imports a server-only module DIRECTLY, which is the shape that
 * shows up in a diff and the shape a reviewer can see. It cannot see one hop
 * further: a client component importing `@/lib/audit`, which imports
 * `@/lib/prisma`, ships the database client to the browser exactly as the direct
 * import would, and no regex over a single file can know that.
 *
 * Next.js does have a build-time answer — `import "server-only"` in the leaf
 * module makes the compiler refuse the whole chain — and that remains the better
 * long-term fix. It is not this pull request's change to make: `server-only`
 * throws when evaluated outside a React Server Component, this suite runs in
 * Node, and 122 test files already carry `vi.mock("server-only", …)` for the
 * modules that have it today. Putting it on `@/lib/prisma` would put that
 * requirement on essentially every test in the repository, and the only proof
 * the change was safe would be a full `next build`.
 *
 * So the reach is asserted here instead, where it is cheap and where it runs
 * inside the REQUIRED `verify` check. This walks the real import graph from
 * every `"use client"` module and fails with the shortest path it found.

/**
 * The leaves a browser bundle must never reach. `@/lib/prisma` and `@/lib/auth`
 * are the two that do NOT fail the Next build today, because neither imports
 * `server-only` — so they are the two that would ship silently.
 *
 * THIS LIST IS THE GUARD. It is not a sample of the server-only modules and
 * there is no rule that adds new ones automatically, so a module that is not
 * named here is not protected by this census however plainly its own docblock
 * says it is. `@/lib/club-time-zone-env` (#2989) is here for that reason: it
 * reads `process.env.TZ` and is deliberately NOT marked `server-only`, because
 * two of its callers are `tsx` entrypoints that a `server-only` import would
 * abort. Next inlines `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` into the browser bundle, so a
 * `"use client"` component importing it would silently answer from the
 * BUILD-TIME `NEXT_PUBLIC_TZ` rather than from the running server — the
 * split-brain second authority `INV-CONFIG-002` forbids and the one that module
 * exists to prevent. Its sibling `@/lib/club-time-zone` is pure validation with
 * no environment read and is deliberately NOT here: the admin panel needs its
 * zone list.
 *
 * `@/lib/environment-role-declaration` and `@/lib/environment-role` (#3034,
 * epic #2986) are here for the same reason and a sharper one. Neither is
 * `server-only` — `setup-readiness-db.ts` reaches the resolver from the `tsx`
 * entrypoint `npm run setup`, which such an import would abort — and the
 * declaration module reads `process.env.APP_ENVIRONMENT_ROLE`. A client
 * component importing it would answer from whatever the bundler inlined at
 * build time for a NON-public variable, which is `undefined`: the browser would
 * read "nothing has declared this installation" while the server reads
 * `production`. What is keyed on that answer is whether the club's real members
 * get emailed (INV-CONFIG-003), so a second authority here is worse than the
 * timezone one, not merely analogous.
