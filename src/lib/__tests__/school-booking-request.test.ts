/*
 * The #2619 hosting participant fence.

 * Every approval path reconciles the hosting review inside its own transaction,
 * and that reconciliation locks the source booking's owner Member row
 * `FOR KEY SHARE NOWAIT` before re-reading, UNDER the lock, both the Member rows
 * and each source booking's owner and lodge. The approval PLANS its participants
 * from `booking.findUnique`, so the same transaction's `booking.findMany` has to
 * replay exactly what that read served or the fence sees drift that never
 * happened. `recordingBookingDouble` does the replay, which is why a test states
 * the booking a transaction serves through `serveBooking` instead of re-stubbing
 * `prisma.booking.findUnique`: re-stubbing would replace the recording wrapper
 * and the fence would find no source booking at all.
 *
 * The default is `null` — the "booking not found" branch the mocked client
 * documents above, which writes nothing. It is re-armed per test, because
 * `vi.clearAllMocks()` clears CALLS but not implementations and a booking row
 * left behind by an earlier test is a database state that never existed.
