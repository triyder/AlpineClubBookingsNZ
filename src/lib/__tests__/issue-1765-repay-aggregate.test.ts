// #1765 — proves the MONEY MATH of the repay-after-refund model, which the
// route/guard tests (which mock upsertPaymentIntentTransaction) never exercise.
// The owner flagged the net-based invariant alignment as "the first thing worth
// checking in review": after a booking is paid, fully refunded, repriced, then
// repaid on the SAME Payment row, the aggregate mirror must reproduce the
// owner-verified production shape — amountCents 28500 / refundedAmountCents
// 19500 / PARTIALLY_REFUNDED — because reconcilePaymentAggregates DERIVES the
// mirror from the transaction ledger (gross = sum of captured-status
// transactions, which INCLUDES REFUNDED; refunded is monotonic per #1353). The
// mirror is a derived idempotent sum, never an increment, so no retry can
// double-count.
