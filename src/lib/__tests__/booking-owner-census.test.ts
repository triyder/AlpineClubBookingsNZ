/**
 * WHO OWNS THIS BOOKING IS READ IN ONE PLACE — the guard (#3368, `INV-SSOT-005`).
 *
 * Stage 3 of programme #2912 replaced every direct read of a booking's member
 * with `bookingOwner()`. This census is what keeps that true: it reads every
 * non-test source file from disk and fails when a direct read comes back.
 *
 * `pnpm run test:related` CANNOT SELECT THIS FILE. It has no import edge to the
 * tree it scans, so the module graph cannot reach it from a changed file — the
 * same blind spot `AGENTS.md` names for the other disk-scanning censuses in
 * this directory. It is CI-caught by design; run it by name.
 *
 * ## What it looks for, and what it deliberately cannot see
 *
 * A read is `X.member` or `X.memberId` where `X` is a booking. Three ways of
 * knowing that `X` is a booking, in descending order of how much of the tree
 * they cover:
 *
 * 1. **Its NAME ends in "booking"** — `booking`, `fullBooking`,
 *    `payment.booking`, `reviewedBooking`. This is most of the tree and it is
 *    also the shape a new reader is overwhelmingly likely to be written in.
 * 2. **It was BOUND from the booking delegate in the same file** —
 *    `const fresh = await tx.booking.findUnique(...)`. This is the one that
 *    earns its keep: it is how the sweep found `fresh`, `held`, `key`,
 *    `lockTarget` and `entry`, five aliases that a name-based scan cannot see
 *    and that a TYPE-based census missed as well, because each of them selects
 *    two or three columns and nothing in that selection says "booking".
 * 3. **It is the callback parameter of an iteration over something named for
 *    bookings** — `bookings.map((b) => …)`.
 *
 * **Stated limits, because a census that hides its blind spots is worse than no
 * census.** A booking reached through a parameter typed elsewhere, through
 * `for (const child of children)`, through a bracket access, or through a
 * destructure is not seen — though the destructure is separately asserted to be
 * absent below, so that one is a closed door rather than an open blind spot.
 * What makes those limits tolerable is that the accessor is the ONLY import a
 * new reader would reach for; a reader who has gone to the trouble of aliasing
 * a booking through an untyped parameter has gone past several signposts.
 *
 * ## The lists this publishes, and why they are lists rather than counts
 *
 * Stage 4 (#3369) makes the member link optional. The three families below are
 * where a missing member is a correctness problem rather than a display one, so
 * this census keeps them enumerated and current — for the next stage to work
 * from, and so nobody re-derives them by hand at the moment they matter.
 * **Re-measure by running this test; never edit a list by incrementing it.**
 *
 * ## The blind spot this census has NOT closed, stated rather than implied
 *
 * Everything here scans for a property READ. Two #3369 defect shapes have no
 * read to find, and a reader who takes this census as covering them will be
 * wrong:
 *
 * - **A Prisma `select` that omits `organisation`.** The accessor can only
 *   build the owner projection when both relations were loaded. The compiler
 *   catches most of it — `Booking.member` is optional now, so reading through
 *   it without the projection is a type error — but an OPTIONAL CHAIN
 *   type-checks and renders a blank. That is the third family below, which is
 *   why it is enumerated.
 * - **A `where` clause that filters THROUGH the relation.** `member: { is: … }`
 *   on a nullable to-one silently excludes every organisation-owned booking
 *   from a page, its pagination window and its count. There is no read and no
 *   type error, and nothing distinguishes a deliberate member-only scope from
 *   an accidental one. This census does not see it and cannot be made to.
 *
 * ## The half of that blind spot that turned out to be closable
 *
 * The paragraphs above were written believing the compiler held the WRITING
 * side while only the READING side needed a census. It does not, and the fourth
 * family below exists because of what that cost.
 *
 * A `select` or `include` is checked against the model only at the TOP level of
 * a Prisma call. A nested one is inferred from the literal itself and then
 * compared with itself, so a relation key the model does not declare compiles
 * silently and raises `PrismaClientValidationError` on the first real call:
 * "Unknown field `organisation` for select statement on model `BookingGuest`".
 * A `select` written where a FILTER belongs fails the same way. Neither shape
 * reaches a test that does not execute the query, and `pnpm run typecheck` is
 * green for both — measured, not assumed.
 *
 * #3369's ownership sweep added `organisation` beside `member` in several
 * hundred selections, textually, because `member:` is the shape it was looking
 * for. Thirteen of those landed where no such relation exists — on
 * `BookingGuest` (the guest's OWN member link, which has nothing to do with who
 * owns the booking), on `HutLeaderAssignment`, on `MemberSubscription`, on
 * `MembershipCancellationRequestParticipant` — and two landed inside a `where`.
 * Every one of them was a crash: the lodge kiosk's guest list, the bed
 * allocation board, the lodge wall's custodian panel, the member-night conflict
 * check on the booking-create path, hut-leader eligibility, and three Xero
 * record pages. They would have shipped.
 *
 * So the fourth family does not scan for a read at all. It resolves each
 * `organisation` selection key back to the model it is written against, through
 * this repository's own datamodel, and fails when there is no such relation
 * there. That is a fact about the schema rather than a judgement about intent,
 * which is exactly why it can be a guard where "is this member-only scope
 * deliberate?" cannot.

/**
 * The three families stage 4 (#3369) HAS NOW DECIDED, site by site.
 *
 * Both are asserted as sorted lists rather than counts: when one changes, the
 * failure shows WHICH site arrived. The #2912 census put the first family at
 * ten and the second at three; both were floors measured on an older tree.
 *
 * WHAT EACH LIST MEANS NOW THAT STAGE 4 HAS LANDED:
 *
 * - The **ownership comparisons** are unchanged in behaviour and deliberately
 *   so. Each is still `bookingOwner(x).memberId !== session.user.id`, still
 *   unconditionally true for an organisation-owned booking, and still means
 *   "not the actor's own" — which is correct, because an organisation never
 *   signs in. The decision is recorded in `src/lib/booking-owner.ts`. The list
 *   stays because entitling a named school liaison to act is a product change
 *   somebody will one day make, and this is the list they will need.
 * - The **member-keyed helpers** have collapsed from seventeen to ONE, and the
 *   collapse is the evidence. Every other site now binds the owner to a local
 *   and branches on it — no member, no ledger — so it no longer matches a
 *   pattern that looks for the owner passed straight in. The one that remains
 *   is a ternary in the diagnostics finance pack, where the branch and the call
 *   are on the same line; it is guarded exactly like the rest.

 * THE PARTIAL SELECT, seen from the only side a text scan can see it (#3369).
 *
 * The census above scans for a property READ. It cannot see a Prisma `select`
 * that simply OMITS `organisation` — there is no read there to find — and that
 * omission is the third #3369 defect class: `bookingOwner()` can only build the
 * owner projection when the caller loaded BOTH relations, so a query that takes
 * `member` alone hands a school booking's `member` back as `null` and the screen
 * says "Unknown member". Two capacity conflict queries shipped exactly that.
 *
 * WHAT ACTUALLY CATCHES IT is the compiler, in every case but one.
 * `Booking.member` is optional since #3369, so a caller that selected the member
 * alone gets `member: M | null` straight through
 * {@link BookingOwnerView} — and `bookingOwner(x).member.firstName` on that is a
 * type error. The one escape is an OPTIONAL CHAIN, which type-checks, renders a
 * blank, and looks like ordinary defensiveness. That is precisely how both
 * capacity queries passed review.
 *
 * So this family is ENUMERATED rather than banned, because the chain has a
 * legitimate reason too — and, measured across all ten sites, the legitimate
 * reason is the commoner one. The accessor's own docblock records it: a booking
 * that NAMES a member whose row could not be read hands back what the caller
 * has, which is nothing. A caller guarding that documented state loads the
 * organisation AND writes a chain, and its chain is correct even though the
 * TYPE says non-null.
 *
 * The point of the list, therefore, is not that a chain is wrong. It is that
 * the two cases are indistinguishable from the chain alone, so each site has to
 * be TRACED to the query that produced it — and a list is what makes an
 * untraced new one visible. That tracing found one real defect among ten:
 * `roster-eligibility.ts` selected the member without the organisation, so a
 * school's chore group lost its name and degraded to "Booking group 3".
 *
 * STILL NOT SEEN, and saying so is the point of writing it down: a `where`
 * clause that filters THROUGH the relation. `where: { member: { is: … } }` on a
 * nullable to-one excludes every organisation-owned booking from the page, the
 * pagination window and the count, with no property read and no type error
 * anywhere — which is how the admin bookings list search dropped every school
 * booking. Nothing here can see that shape, and no scanner in this tree can tell
 * a deliberate member-only scope from an accidental one. It is a reviewer's job.
