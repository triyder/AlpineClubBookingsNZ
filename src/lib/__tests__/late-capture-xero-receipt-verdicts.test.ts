/**
 * #3924 round 11 (`INV-PAY-110`, `INV-PAY-122`): TWO VERDICTS OF ONE RECEIPT.
 * A late capture's receipt row an officer resolved by hand is the officer's
 * record for every card-refund path - the refund note's eligible cash, the
 * card-note gap, the late-capture refund repair - exactly as before #3924, so
 * none of them raises or counts a card note for it. Only a refund closed as
 * paid another way reads the wider verdict, where a row resolved after the app
 * sent it, or a change linked in Xero, is the app's own invoice and the close's
 * note follows it. The real reader runs here over an in-memory store; the
 * callers around it are real too, with only their other reads stubbed.
