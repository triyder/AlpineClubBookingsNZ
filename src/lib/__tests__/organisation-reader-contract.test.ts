/**
 * WHO READS A SCHOOL'S ORGANISATION RECORD — programme #2912, stages 1 and 2.
 *
 * THIS FILE REPLACES `organisation-record-inert-contract.test.ts`, and the
 * replacement is deliberate rather than incidental. Stage 1 (#3366) shipped
 * that file to prove its own claim of inertness: the records exist, are
 * reachable, and NOTHING in the tree reads them. That claim was true for exactly
 * one release. Stage 2 (#3367) is the release where things start to read them,
 * so a test asserting "zero readers" had to go — but deleting it would have
 * traded a real guarantee for nothing.
 *
 * The property worth keeping was never "zero readers". It was **the readers are
 * the ones somebody decided on**, and that survives the change: the allowlist
 * below is now stage 2's deliberate reader set, each entry carrying the part it
 * plays, still asserted with `toEqual` against an exact list. An unplanned
 * reader — stage 3's sweep arriving early, or an unrelated lane reaching for the
 * link — still fails here and still has to be argued for.
 *
 * Three things are pinned, and each answers one of the two issues' criteria.
 *
 *  1. THE RECORDS EXIST AND ARE REACHABLE. `Organisation` and
 *     `OrganisationContact` are in the datamodel, and a booking and a booking
 *     request each carry an OPTIONAL link to an organisation. Optional is the
 *     load-bearing half: a nullable column is what lets the currently deployed
 *     release keep reading these two tables, because its inserts omit the
 *     column and a nullable column with no default accepts that. Stage 2 adds
 *     no column at all, so this section is unchanged and still true.
 *
 *  2. NO EXISTING QUERY CHANGES ITS RESULT. Every scalar column of `Booking`
 *     and `BookingRequest` is pinned against the list the PRE-STAGE schema
 *     declared, in order, read out of a Prisma client generated from
 *     `origin/epic/2725-mad` at `5c9c09882`. Drop stage 1's one added column
 *     and a default-selection read serialises BYTE FOR BYTE as it did before —
 *     asserted on the JSON, not merely on the set, so a column inserted in a
 *     way that reorders its neighbours fails here too.
 *
 *  3. THE READERS ARE EXACTLY THE DECLARED ONES, AND THEY DO THE DECLARED JOB.
 *     Every non-test source file in the tree is scanned for the identifiers this
 *     programme introduced; a hit outside the allowlist fails. And because an
 *     allowlist of readers rots into a list of files that happen to mention a
 *     word, the last section asserts what each declared file actually reads the
 *     link FOR.
 *
 * `pnpm run test:related` cannot select this file: it reads the tree from disk
 * and has no import edge to what it scans, so like the other censuses in this
 * directory it is CI-caught by design.

/**
 * THE READERS, AND WHAT STAGE 4 (#3369) DID TO THIS CENSUS.
 *
 * Read the stage-2 note below first; it explains why an exact allowlist existed
 * at all. Stage 4 is the arrival it anticipated — "an unplanned reader arriving
 * in stage 3's sweep, or in an unrelated lane, still fails here and still has to
 * be argued for". This is the argument.
 *
 * **A booking's owner cannot be read without the organisation.** `bookingOwner()`
 * projects a school into person shape, and it can only do that from a school it
 * was given — so every query that renders an owner selects
 * `organisation: { select: { name, email } }` beside its `member`. That is not a
 * reader of the organisation in the sense this census was built to police; it is
 * the accessor's INPUT, and it arrives in a hundred files by design.
 *
 * So the rule is narrowed rather than abandoned, and it keeps its teeth exactly
 * where they were sharp:
 *
 * - **The plain owner SELECTION is exempt** — `organisation: { select: { name:
 *   true, email: true } }` and the type-position spelling of the same thing.
 *   It decides nothing; `INV-SSOT-005`'s own census is what keeps those reads
 *   going through the accessor.
 * - **Everything else still has to be declared**: a delegate reach for an
 *   organisation record, the `OrganisationContact` model, the `OrganisationKind`
 *   enum, a write of `organisationId`, and any select of the organisation that
 *   asks for more than the owner projection needs. Those are the files that
 *   DECIDE something about a school, and that set is still small and still
 *   argued for.
 *
 * THE READERS, and why this replaced an inertness test rather than deleting it.
 *
 * Stage 1 (#3366) shipped `organisation-record-inert-contract.test.ts`, whose
 * third section proved that NOTHING in the tree read or wrote the organisation
 * link. That claim was true for exactly one release, and #3367 is the release
 * where things start to read it — so the test had to change. Deleting the
 * section would have traded a real guarantee for nothing, because the property
 * worth keeping was never "zero readers": it was **the readers are the ones
 * somebody decided on**.
 *
 * So the section is REPLACED, not removed. The allowlist below is now the set of
 * readers and writers stage 2 deliberately adds, each with the role it plays,
 * and the assertion is still `toEqual` against an exact list. An unplanned
 * reader arriving in stage 3's sweep, or in an unrelated lane, still fails here
 * and still has to be argued for — which is the whole value the stage-1 census
 * had.
 *
 * `pnpm run test:related` cannot select this file: it reads the tree from disk
 * and has no import edge to what it scans, so like the other censuses in this
 * directory it is CI-caught by design.

 * the very file this census borrows its walker from
 * (`support/booking-guest-night-writer-scan.ts`) counts aliased delegates with
 * a syntax tree precisely because the shape occurs in this repository.
 *
 * Four forms remain out of reach, and all four are STATED LIMITS rather than
 * gaps worth more regex: a bracket delegate, a delegate resolved through a
 * variable, a raw `$queryRaw` naming the table (the bare token is deliberately
 * unscanned, for the collision reason above — though raw SQL naming the COLUMN
