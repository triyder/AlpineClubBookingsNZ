/**
 * Census: every place a stay becomes nights is declared here (#2628).
 *
 * `BookingGuestNight` is the canonical night set. `BookingGuest.stayStart` /
 * `stayEnd` is a DERIVED half-open envelope whose `stayEnd` is the morning
 * after the last night (INV-DATE-012). They agree for a contiguous stay; for a
 * SPARSE one the envelope silently fills the internal gaps. Six sites expanded
 * a stay into nights and three of them read the envelope, so a guest booked on
 * nights {1, 3} was reported as awaiting a bed forever, could never reach
 * `"complete"`, and could only ever be checked out once.
 *
 * The fix routed those three at one helper module. The failure mode that comes
 * BACK is a seventh copy: somebody needs a night list, writes
 * `eachDateOnlyInRange(guest.stayStart, guest.stayEnd)` because it is two
 * imports away, and the sparse case is wrong again in a new place. The
 * inventory lived in reviewers' heads, so this file makes it mechanical, in the
 * style of `night-occupancy-census.test.ts` and `api-route-boundaries.test.ts`:
 * a new expansion site has to be classified here or the build fails.
 *
 * ## What this census does and does not guarantee
 *
 * It is a SOURCE-TEXT census over `src/`. It guarantees that no expansion
 * written with `eachDateOnlyInRange` over a `stay*` bound can appear without
 * being declared — and it counts them PER SITE, not per file, so a SECOND
 * expansion added to an already-declared file fails too. That distinction is the
 * whole guard for `src/lib/bed-allocation-board.ts`, which is declared for an
 * unrelated whole-lodge booking envelope and is also the file the original
 * `countGuestsAwaitingBed` defect lived in. It matches across line breaks, so
 * wrapping the call over several lines does not hide it, and it treats
 * `clampGuestToRange` as a stay bound by another name.
 *
 * What it still cannot see: an expansion that inlines its own day loop, one that
 * reaches the envelope through locals named nothing like a stay bound
 * (`const { start, end } = somethingElse(guest); eachDateOnlyInRange(start, end)`
 * — the `clampGuestToRange` clause closes today's only such route, not the
 * general shape), and anything outside `src/`, so `scripts/` and `prisma/` are
 * out of scope. That residue is stated rather than implied — every expansion in
 * the tree today is written the declared way, so the census covers the whole
 * current inventory.

 *                    guest's stay. A booking has no night set, so there is
 *                    nothing sparse to get wrong.
 *  - `night-set-first` — expands the envelope only as a fallback for a guest
 *                    carrying no `BookingGuestNight` rows, which is exactly
 *                    `getGuestBedNightKeys`'s own rule. Correct as written;
 *                    each one is a local copy that could be routed at the
 *                    helper later, and none may lose its night-set branch.
 *  - `plan-range`  — expanded a PLAN's own `[stayStart, stayEnd)` window, on the
 *                    argument that the window was contiguous by construction
 *                    because the shape it came from had no night field at all.
 *                    #2736 gave that shape a night field, so the one site of
 *                    this kind is gone and the classification is RETIRED. Do not
 *                    revive it: "the plan flattened it before this point" is a
 *                    reason to go and look at the plan, which is what #2736 was.

  // `ProposedExistingGuestRange` carries the guest's canonical `nights`, and the
  // per-night amounts are computed over that LIST instead of by re-expanding an
  // envelope (#2744 then made them each night's real rate rather than an even
  // split of the guest's total, still over the same list). There is no expansion
  // left in the file, so it is gone from the table rather than sitting here at
  // zero — the first test below derives the found set from the source, and a
  // declared file with nothing in it fails it.
  // `booking-edit-guest-ranges.ts` does not replace it: the plan now calls the

  // looks like (INV-DATE-020) and is deliberately not a census site.

  // Nor does `src/lib/diagnostics/tools/packs/booking-evidence.ts`, and it is worth
