/**
 * INV-CONFIG-005: no Xero contact write can put a member's real email address on
 * a contact without asking which installation this is (ENV-SAFETY 3, #3036;
 * epic #2986).
 *
 * WHAT THIS ADDS THAT THE TYPE SYSTEM DOES NOT. The primary guarantee is a type:
 * the two contact-payload builders in `xero-contacts.ts` take an
 * `XeroContactEmailPolicy`, which only `xero-contact-containment.ts` can mint,
 * and it mints one only after reading the canonical environment role. So an
 * existing builder cannot be called without the question being asked. That is
 * stronger than any census, because it is not a list of the writers that exist
 * today.
 *
 * It has three holes, and this file closes all three:
 *
 * 1. **A brand-new `createContacts` / `updateContact` call**, in a module that
 *    builds its own payload and never touches the two existing builders. No type
 *    stands in its way.
 * 2. **A second `emailAddress:` assignment inside `xero-contacts.ts`** that
 *    forgets the policy — the file already holds two, so a third is an ordinary
 *    edit.
 * 3. **A cast.** `{} as unknown as XeroContactEmailPolicy` type-checks. The
 *    module refuses a forged token at runtime, so the cast fails closed rather
 *    than working — but a source census catches it in review instead of in
 *    production.
 *
 * `test:related` CANNOT select this file: it reads the repository from disk with
 * `fs`, so it has no import edge to the files it scans. Run it explicitly, and
 * expect CI to be the backstop (`docs/TESTING.md`).
 *
 * EVERY CASE BELOW ASSERTS THAT THE REGION IT EXTRACTED CONTAINS THE THING IT
 * CLAIMS TO JUDGE. Five guards in this epic shipped vacuous — a
 * `toContain("PRODUCTION")` that matched `"NON-PRODUCTION"`, ordering assertions
 * a mutant sailed through, a glob test carrying its own copy of the regex, a
 * body slice that landed on a multi-line return type, and a requirement whose
 * mutant passed 218 of 218 tests — and every one was found by a mutation probe
 * rather than by reading. This one assumes it is the sixth.

      — the operator has to know which contacts, whose they are, and where to
      click — and the guide's repair steps refer to it by name ("using the links
      below"), so a screen without it makes the documentation wrong too.

      A SOURCE census AS WELL AS a render test, not instead of one. The earlier
      version of this comment said there was no harness for this screen and that
      inventing one was the worse trade, and that was false — `react-dom/server`
      and `@testing-library/react` are both here and dozens of admin components
      are rendered in tests. The render test is
      `src/components/admin/__tests__/environment-xero-containment.test.tsx`. This
      census earns its place on a different question: it pins WHICH FIELDS reach
      the screen and that no email address can, which markup assertions express
      poorly and which is the property an operator's repair depends on.

      `xeroContactUrl`, `memberName`, `memberId`, `rewrittenAt` — so TypeScript
      already refuses `contact.email` outright, and the component contains no
      destructuring or bracket access that could route around it. Measured: its
      only `contact.*` references are those five.

      This assertion is the cheap second line, and it is deliberately narrow. It
      cannot see `const { email } = contact`, `contact["email"]`, a different
      identifier name, or an address smuggled inside `memberName`. Widening it to
      `/email/i` was considered and rejected: nine lines of legitimate operator
      copy in this same file mention email, so the wide form would fail on
      correct code, and a guard that cries wolf gets exempted and is then worth
      nothing. Keep it narrow, and do not let it carry the privacy claim on its
      own — the type does that.

      Its `\b` was a literal 0x08 byte until #3072, which made the pattern
      unmatchable and this negative assertion unconditionally true. It passes on
      merit now: re-run after the repair, it finds no violation.
