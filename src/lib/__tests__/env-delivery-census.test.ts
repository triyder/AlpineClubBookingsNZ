/**
 * A SETTING AN OPERATOR CAN SEE IN THEIR `.env` MUST ACTUALLY REACH THE APP
 * (ENV-SAFETY 2, #3035; epic #2986; INV-CONFIG-004).
 *
 * ## The defect this exists for, and why nothing else caught it
 *
 * `docker compose --env-file X` feeds Compose **interpolation** only. It injects
 * nothing into a container. A variable that is not named in a service's
 * `environment:` map — directly or through the `x-app-environment` anchor —
 * simply does not exist for the application, however carefully an env file, an
 * env example or a CI heredoc sets it.
 *
 * #3035's first cut shipped exactly that. `.env.staging.example` and both E2E
 * workflow heredocs set `USE_LOCAL_CAPTURE=true`; no Compose file named it; so
 * the E2E app container saw `USE_AWS_SES=false`, `USE_SMTP_RELAY=false` and no
 * capture declaration.
 *
 * AND THE FAILURE WAS SILENT, which is the part that matters for how this file is
 * written. Both legacy flags were *defined and false*, so the parser never
 * reached its implicit-legacy-default branch: it took the "exactly one email
 * provider flag must be true" issue, resolved mode `invalid`, transport
 * `unresolved`, and the delivery policy answered `suppress_non_production`. That
 * is a NORMAL terminal outcome — logged at info, one `SKIPPED_NON_PRODUCTION` row
 * per message, no error anywhere. An operator log-diving finds nothing. The
 * browser suite simply reads an empty mailbox and fails five specs on a symptom
 * that names nothing.
 *
 * The census that was supposed to catch it greped the four stack FILES for the
 * declaration text and was green, because the text was there. A text census over
 * the files cannot see whether the container gets the variable. So:
 *
 * - **GUARD A** (no Docker, unconditional) asserts the property that
 *   generalises: every variable this repository DECLARES and READS must be
 *   DELIVERED by some Compose service, or be listed with a reason. It would have
 *   caught `USE_LOCAL_CAPTURE` without anybody having to think of it.
 * - **GUARD B** (`docker compose config`) asserts the RENDER: the real resolved
 *   environment of every service that runs app code, including that exactly one
 *   transport flag is true. Presence alone catches this whole class.
 *
 * ## Anti-vacuity rules, because four guards in this epic have shipped vacuous
 *
 * Every case below asserts its own inputs are non-empty before it judges them,
 * and the reason map is asserted to hold no stale entry. Guard B FAILS on a
 * non-zero `docker compose` exit rather than skipping, and reports the stderr.
 *
 * `test:related` CANNOT select this file: it reads YAML, shell and `src/` from
 * disk with `fs`, so it has no import edge to anything it scans. Run it
 * explicitly and expect CI to be the backstop (`docs/TESTING.md`).

 *
 * So the work itself is ~200 ms and CONTENTION is the whole variable — which is
 * exactly what a 4-core CI runner executing the rest of the suite in parallel
 * supplies, and why CI has already been seen past 5000 ms while the worst local
 * contention reached 2104 ms. 30 s is ~147x the idle render, ~14x the worst
 * contended one measured, and >=6x the budget that actually blew on CI, while
 * still failing a genuinely hung `docker compose` in half a minute instead of
 * hanging the job.
 *
 * A HANG-CATCHER, NOT A PASS MARK — the same footing as
 * `./helpers/migration-gate-timeouts.ts`, which budgets the bash gate suites at
 * 60 s for the same fork-cost reason. On CI these finish in well under a second,
 * so this number never decides a pull request; if one ever burns 30 s, something
 * is genuinely wrong and the test SHOULD fail.
 *

 * what catches a hung test everywhere else in this suite, and widening it for
 * six subprocess tests would blunt it for thousands of others — `vitest.setup.ts`
 * also states that 5,000 ms and calibrates the 4,000 ms RTL window against it.
