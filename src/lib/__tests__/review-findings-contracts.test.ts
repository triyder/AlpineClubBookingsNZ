        //
        // 1. ADMIN-ONLY, and doubly so. The one entry that reaches this call,
        //    diagnostics.booking_block_state, requires BOTH `bookings:view` AND
        //    `membership:view`. `member-guest-add-policy.ts`'s own docblock states
        //    the doctrine in as many words — "ADMIN AND ON-BEHALF PATHS ARE
        //    EXEMPT… an officer is entitled to the detail" — and this is the same
        //    entitlement `link-conflicts/route.ts` is exempt on.
        //
        // 2. MARKING WOULD BLIND THE DIAGNOSTIC ON THE EXACT BOOKINGS IT EXISTS
        //    TO EXPLAIN. The marker does not redact a conflict row; it makes the
        //    guard THROW `memberGuestCrossFamilyRefusal` instead of returning one.
        //    This source awaits the guard inside a `Promise.all` and refuses the
        //    whole row rather than returning a partial one, so a marked party
        //    would turn every booking carrying a cross-family person-night clash
        //    into `evidence_unavailable` — the one answer an officer investigating
        //    "why is this booking blocked" cannot use.
        //
        // 3. NOTHING THE MARKER PROTECTS IS PROJECTED. The guard's row carries
        //    `memberName`, `conflictingNights` and the counterpart booking; this
        //    source reads `conflicts.length` and nothing else, and the registry
        //    projection emits a single integer, `memberNightConflictCount`. The
        //    call also passes the least-privileged actor it can — the booking's
        //    OWN owner with `actorRole: "USER"`, never the administrator running
        //    the diagnostic — so the guard never attaches its admin-gated fields
        //    in the first place. A contract test in the pack's own suite pins
        //    that the projection carries a count and no conflict detail.
        "read-only admin diagnostic requiring bookings:view AND membership:view; projects the conflict COUNT only, calls the guard as the booking's own owner with actorRole USER, and marking would make the guard throw a neutral refusal instead of answering — blinding the tool on exactly the bookings it exists to explain",
