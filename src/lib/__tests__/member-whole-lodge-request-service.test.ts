  #2263 — the member whole-lodge request service.

  The privacy argument for this feature is STRUCTURAL, and this file is where
  that structure is pinned. The acknowledgement a member receives is uniform not
  because a delay was tuned but because the handler and the service between them
  never look at the calendar: no booking query, no capacity query, no season
  query, no pricing. A test that only checked the response body would pass
  equally well against an implementation that branched on availability and then
  discarded the answer — and that implementation would leak through timing. So
  the assertions below are about which queries are ISSUED.
