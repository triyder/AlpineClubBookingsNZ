/**
 * REAL cross-connection contention proof for the per-lodge capacity lock (#172,
 * H1 from the PR #1911 adversarial review).
 *
 * Mock-level route tests can only assert that `acquireLodgeCapacityLock` is
 * *called*; they cannot prove that two genuine Postgres connections actually
 * serialise on the same advisory key. This suite does exactly that, against a
 * reachable database.
 *
 * It replicates the exact SQL both call sites emit:
 *   - the admission path (`acquireLodgeCapacityLock`, src/lib/capacity.ts) and
 *   - the exclusive-hold / hold-set path (same helper, exclusive-hold/route.ts)
 * both run `SELECT pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtextextended($lodgeId, 0))`, so a
 * confirm-pending-guests admission and a hold-set for the *same* lodge must
 * mutually exclude. The legacy club-wide `pg_advisory_xact_lock(1)` this route
 * used to take is a disjoint key and never excluded either — which is the bug.
 *
 * Gated on CONTENTION_TEST_DATABASE_URL so the dummy-DATABASE_URL unit gate
 * skips it cleanly; run it locally against the dev Postgres:
 *   CONTENTION_TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://tac:tacdev@localhost:5433/tacbookings" \
 *     npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/lodge-capacity-lock.integration.test.ts
 *
 * Uses advisory locks only — creates and mutates no rows — and disconnects both
 * connections cleanly.
