/**
 * The #2751 backfill's CONTRACT: the migration's literal action list and the
 * writers #2730 reclassified must name the same events, in both directions.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `AuditLog.category` is stored on the row at write time
 * and never re-derived, so a reclassification splits that event's history at the
 * release boundary until a backfill moves the rows already written. #2730 moved
 * 22 writers and no rows; #2751 moved the rows. Nothing mechanical connected the
 * two — the audit-writer census reads the TREE and can never see a stored row,
 * and the migration is one-shot SQL that no test executed against real data
 * until its verification fixture existed. So the pairing was prose, and the next
 * bed-allocation writer added to `REVIEWED_ADMIN_CATEGORIES_2730` would have
 * re-opened the split with nothing failing.
 *
 * WHAT IT CATCHES, concretely:
 *
 *  - a 23rd site added to `REVIEWED_ADMIN_CATEGORIES_2730` whose action the
 *    backfill does not name (the split re-opens for that event);
 *  - an action name in the backfill that no reviewed site writes (a row rewritten
 *    on the strength of nothing reviewed — the direction that cannot be undone);
 *  - the exact-list rule being replaced by a prefix match, since a `LIKE` pattern
 *    parses to no literal names at all and fails here by name.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT. It is not a general "every reclassification ships a backfill"
 * gate, and INV-OPS-012 says plainly why one is not available: the census pins
 * only 127 of 462 write sites per-site by design, so a reclassification of any
 * other site is invisible to any check that has no per-site baseline to compare
 * against. This is the enforceable half — the population the rule was invented
 * on — and the rest of INV-OPS-012 is a rule a reviewer applies.
 *
 * That figure is not transcribed twice by hand any more: it went stale after
 * #2755 (3 low) and again after #2765 (16 low), so `audit-writer-census.test.ts`
 * now counts the union of the four per-site maps and asserts 127 pinned / 335
 * unpinned. If this sentence and INV-OPS-012 disagree with each other, that test
 * is the one that measured it.
