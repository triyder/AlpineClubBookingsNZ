/**
 * THE canonical answer to "is this installation production?" (ENV-SAFETY 1,
 * #3034; epic #2986). INV-CONFIG-003.
 *
 * Three effective states and no fourth:
 *
 * - `PRODUCTION`     — the deployment declared production and no safer override
 *                      is on. Ordinary production behaviour.
 * - `NON_PRODUCTION` — the deployment declared non-production, or an
 *                      administrator has forced this instance safer.
 * - `UNKNOWN`        — nothing has said. **Not production, and not the same
 *                      thing as confirmed non-production either.** #3035 and
 *                      #3036 fail closed here: an external side effect whose
 *                      safety depends on which installation this is does not
 *                      happen until the configuration is resolved.
 *
 * NOTHING IS EVER INFERRED. Not from `NODE_ENV` (a build mode — a staging
 * container runs a production build), not from `APP_RUNTIME_ROLE` (a deployment
 * naming convention for which SLOT a container is: web-blue, cron-leader,
 * staging), not from a hostname, a branch, a URL, a `DATABASE_URL`, or a
 * provider organisation. Every one of those is a convention that holds until
 * somebody stands up a copy that breaks it, and that is the day it matters.
 *
 * TWO GUARDS HOLD THAT, and they are named here exactly, because a docblock that
 * cites a test file which does not exist is worse than one that cites nothing —
 * the next reader trusts it and stops looking (#3034 review).
 * `environment-role-resolver.test.ts` asserts the answer does not move when all
 * of those variables are set to production-looking and then
 * non-production-looking values. `environment-role-inference-census.test.ts`
 * asserts at source level that neither this module nor
 * `environment-role-declaration.ts` READS any of them — not that they avoid
 * MENTIONING them, which they plainly do not: both explain at length why these
 * variables cannot answer the question, and the census's own comment says the
 * word may appear while a read may not.
 *
 * THE DATABASE CAN ONLY MAKE THE ANSWER SAFER. `EnvironmentSafetySettings` holds
 * one boolean, `forceNonProduction`, and the schema deliberately has no column
 * in which "I am production" could be expressed — so a restored production dump
 * cannot carry a production claim into a staging copy, because there is nothing
 * for it to travel in. Production is declared by the DEPLOYMENT and by nothing
 * else. Turning the override OFF is therefore not an elevation: with it off the
 * declaration decides, and an installation that declares nothing goes back to
 * UNKNOWN rather than to production.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED WHEN THE OVERRIDE CANNOT BE READ, including when the declaration
 * says `production`. An unreadable override means we cannot rule out that an
 * operator has already forced this instance safer — which is the case where
 * getting it wrong emails the club's real members from a copy. This trades no
 * availability the application actually has: every page of this app needs the
 * database, so a database that cannot answer this one-row primary-key read is
 * not an installation that is otherwise serving. The one exception is the leg
 * that is already at the safest answer: with the declaration `non-production`,
 * an unreadable override changes nothing, because the override could only have
 * pushed it where it already is.
 *
 * NO CACHE, DELIBERATELY. This is one primary-key read of a one-row table. A
 * cache would put a staleness window between an administrator switching the
 * safer override on — the button somebody presses when they have just realised a
 * copy is about to email real members — and it taking effect. If a future
 * optimiser wants one, that window is the thing to argue about first.
 *
 * NOT `server-only`, on purpose: `setup-readiness-db.ts` imports this and is
 * itself imported by the `tsx` entrypoint `npm run setup`, which a `server-only`
 * import would abort. It is kept off the client bundle graph by being named a
 * forbidden leaf in both halves of `INV-OPS-013` — see
 * `environment-role-declaration.ts`'s docblock for the two lists and why being
 * in neither means being protected by neither.

 * precisely because the previous wording said the whole order was the invariant,
 * which overstates it — and a docblock a future editor checks and finds wrong is
 * a docblock they then reorder past (#3034 review).
 *
 * 1. A declared `non-production` is final, and BRANCH 1 MUST COME FIRST. It is
 *    already the safest answer, so no database state and no database FAILURE can
 *    move it — and in particular the override cannot elevate it, because the
 *    override has no elevating direction to move it in. Put branch 2 or 3 above
 *    it and a database blip turns a declared copy into UNKNOWN.
 * 2. Otherwise an unreadable override is UNKNOWN, even under a declared
 *    `production`. See the module docblock: we cannot rule out an operator
 *    having forced this instance safer.
 * 3. Otherwise the override, if on, forces NON_PRODUCTION.
 *
 *    BRANCHES 2 AND 3 ARE INTERCHANGEABLE, and saying so is the honest version:
 *    they test disjoint values of the same `kind`, so swapping them changes no
 *    answer. What matters is only that both sit above branch 4.
 * 4. Otherwise the declaration decides: `production` gives PRODUCTION (4a);
 *    `absent` and `invalid` give UNKNOWN (4b). BRANCH 3 MUST COME BEFORE 4a —
 *    that pair is the whole "the database can force safer" rule, and swapping
 *    them makes a declared production ignore an override an administrator has
 *    deliberately switched on. `absent` and `invalid` never become PRODUCTION,
 *    and they stay distinguishable so the operator surface can tell "you have
