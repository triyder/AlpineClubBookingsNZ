// Model-level completeness for config transfer (#2200). PR #2199 (#2178) proved
// no COLUMN inside a registered singleton is silently dropped. This is the
// MODEL-level analogue: every singleton-shaped Prisma model must be either
// registered for export or named in MODEL_LEVEL_EXCLUSIONS with a reason, so a
// newly added settings singleton cannot silently join config transfer's blind
// spot by default. The guard test enumerates singleton-shaped models
// mechanically from prisma/schema.prisma and fails on any that is neither.

/**
 * "Singleton-shaped" is the id="default" upsert pattern every club-settings
 * singleton uses: a model whose `@id` scalar defaults to the literal string
 * "default", so the app reads/writes exactly one row via `where: { id: "default" }`.
 * That is how this repo identifies its config singletons (see the per-model
 * loaders and `categories/club-settings.ts`). Models keyed by `cuid()`/`uuid()`
 * or by a business unique — e.g. `AgeTierSetting` (`@default(cuid())`, `tier
 * @unique`, one row per age tier) — are NOT singletons and are deliberately out
 * of scope for this guard: they are multi-row tables that, if portable, belong
 * in the natural-key entity mechanism, not the singleton upsert path.
 *
 * The signature is read from prisma/schema.prisma TEXT, not the runtime DMMF,
 * because Prisma 7's client-side DMMF strips `isId`/`default` from fields (only
 * name/kind/type survive). Parsing the schema source is both the authoritative
 * signal and a truly mechanical enumeration.
