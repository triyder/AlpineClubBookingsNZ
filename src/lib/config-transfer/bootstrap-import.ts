/**
 * C9 — Config bundle auto-import on boot (ADR-003, disaster-recovery / clone).
 *
 * When `CONFIG_BUNDLE_IMPORT_PATH` names a readable bundle file AND the database
 * is **empty of non-seed configuration**, this module applies that bundle
 * non-interactively at boot, through the EXACT same validated import pipeline
 * (`import.ts` plan → `apply.ts` apply) the interactive admin route uses. It is
 * the mechanism behind the ADR-003 provisioning flow:
 *
 *   deploy env + bundle file → migrations → base seed → **boot auto-import** →
 *   operational site
 *
 * ## Security posture — fail closed everywhere
 * The bundle file is operator-controlled DEPLOYMENT configuration (equivalent to
 * writing `config/club.json` or setting install-time env — a first-install
 * capability, not a privilege escalation; see ADR-003 "Trust model"), but its
 * BYTES are treated as fully untrusted input: the same `readBundle` structural
 * validation, resource caps, `FORBIDDEN_FIELD_PATTERNS` allowlist, and per-field
 * Prisma-DMMF type-checks that guard the interactive path guard this one. The
 * residual risk ADR-003 identifies is a bundle applied to a NON-empty database;
 * the empty-target guard below is what prevents it, so it is designed to fail
 * CLOSED — any doubt about emptiness, any probe query error, any validation
 * error, any plan step that would need a human answer, and any I/O or apply
 * failure all REFUSE the import and leave the database untouched. Boot always
 * continues (best-effort, like the C2 self-heal): the process must never crash
 * because of a bootstrap bundle.
 *
 * ## Order of operations — probe before file I/O
 * The emptiness probe (cheap DB counts) runs FIRST; the bundle file is only
 * statted/read after the probe decides "apply". A configured steady-state
 * target therefore performs ZERO file I/O on boot even while the env var stays
 * set. Before reading, the file is `stat`ed: a non-regular file (device/FIFO),
 * a stat failure, or a size above the pipeline's `MAX_BUNDLE_BYTES` cap refuses
 * without ever loading the bytes into memory.
 *
 * ## "Empty of non-seed configuration" — the precise definition (six signals)
 * The base seed (`prisma/seed.ts`) is create-if-missing and pre-populates the
 * config singletons and keyed rows this importer touches (club identity, theme,
 * lodge, age tiers, seasons/rates, pages, site content, committee roles,
 * induction template, Xero mappings, displays). So a faithful club bundle
 * applied to a freshly-seeded database necessarily produces UPDATEs against those
 * seed placeholders — "the plan has zero updates" is therefore NOT a usable
 * empty-target signal on this codebase (it would refuse every legitimate
 * bootstrap). Emptiness is instead defined as **no operator footprint**: the
 * absence of ALL SIX of these signals, probed positively over state the seed
 * never creates (see {@link assessBootstrapReadiness}; the seed writes no
 * `AuditLog` rows and no `SetupProgress` row):
 *
 *   1. No config bundle has ever been imported — no `configuration.imported`
 *      (interactive) or `configuration.bootstrap_imported` (this feature) audit
 *      row. This is also what makes a second boot idempotent.
 *   2. No bookings exist.
 *   3. No non-system members exist (any `Member` whose role is not one of the
 *      seeded system-account roles ADMIN / LODGE).
 *   4. The setup wizard was never marked finished (`SetupProgress.completedAt`
 *      is null).
 *   5. The setup wizard was never even DRIVEN — no `SetupProgress` row has any
 *      completed or skipped step ids. Step completes/skips leave `completedAt`
 *      null, so signal 4 alone would miss a club configured through
 *      `/admin/setup` without pressing "finish".
 *   6. No audit-log row has a MEMBER actor — no row whose `memberId` or
 *      `actorMemberId` is set to anything other than a `system:`-prefixed
 *      synthetic actor. Coverage rests on per-editor auditing: the admin
 *      configuration editors (the direct config editors — including the chores
 *      and display lodge-config editors — and the wizard steps) all audit with
 *      a member actor, so this catches a club configured through the admin UI
 *      without any of the other footprints. (Successful logins are NOT audited
 *      — only auth bounces are — so this signal does not rest on them.)
 *
 * ALL six must be absent to apply. Any one present refuses — strictly safer
 * than an update-count check, because it also refuses a manually-configured
 * club whose bundle keys happen to collide with seed keys (which an update
 * count could misread as "unchanged"). The refusal distinguishes the calm
 * steady state (a prior bootstrap already ran — INFO) from an unexpected
 * non-empty target (WARN). Any probe query error propagates and is treated as
 * "do not apply".
 *
 * ## Concurrency — the probe is re-run INSIDE the apply lock
 * The boot probe races other writers (concurrent replica boots in the
 * blue/green stack, or an admin importing interactively at the same instant).
 * To close that TOCTOU window the SAME probe is re-run inside the apply
 * transaction, immediately after the `pg_advisory_xact_lock` single-flight
 * lock is acquired and before anything is written. If the in-lock re-check
 * finds the target configured, the transaction rolls back and the refusal is
 * logged CALMLY at INFO — on a multi-replica boot this is the healthy expected
 * outcome for every replica that lost the race (the first replica won and
 * applied). Combined with the bootstrap marker being written INSIDE the same
 * transaction (see below), at most one bootstrap apply can ever commit.
 *
 * ## Non-interactive abort — CAN trip on a post-seed target
 * Any plan item with rename candidates (a key-weak entity that did not match
 * exactly but has existing rows it could be a rename of) aborts the bootstrap
 * rather than guessing. This is NOT unreachable on a legitimate bootstrap: the
 * base seed creates key-weak rows (the default induction template, the example
 * chore templates), so a bundle from a source club that RENAMED those defaults
 * produces candidates against a faithfully-seeded target and the whole import
 * refuses (nothing written). That fail-closed outcome is deliberate; the
 * documented fallback is the interactive import (Admin → Setup & Configuration
 * → Export & Import), where a human resolves the renames. The abort log
 * enumerates the affected entities so the operator knows what to resolve.
 *
 * ## Provenance guard — deliberately NOT applied
 * The C2 self-heal is gated on `clubConfigSource === "primary"` to avoid freezing
 * FALLBACK config values into create-if-absent rows. The bootstrap import is
 * intentionally NOT gated on config provenance: the BUNDLE is the config source
 * in the DR scenario, and `config/club.json` is often absent there (that is the
 * whole reason to restore from a bundle), so provenance is typically
 * `"safe-default"`. Gating on `"primary"` would disable the feature exactly when
 * it is needed. The self-heal's hazard does not transfer, because this importer
 * writes the BUNDLE's values, never the effective fallback config. On a
 * SAFE_DEFAULT boot the self-heal skips (writing nothing) and the bootstrap
 * import then populates the database from the bundle — no double-write, no
 * conflict. Provenance is recorded in logs for observability only.
 *
 * ## Interaction with the C2 self-heal (runs first, in the same boot)
 * The self-heal runs BEFORE this module. Whether it wrote rows or skipped, there
 * is no conflict: the emptiness probe deliberately looks at operational
 * footprint, NOT at config-singleton presence, so self-healed rows never make
 * the target look "non-empty". If the self-heal created identity/age-tier rows
 * (primary-config clone), this importer simply upserts over them with the
 * bundle's authoritative values; if it skipped (safe-default DR), this importer
 * creates them. On the NEXT boot the self-heal sees the rows present (skips) and
 * this importer sees the `configuration.bootstrap_imported` marker (refuses).
 *
 * ## "Exactly one write" — what is actually guaranteed
 * The `configuration.bootstrap_imported` marker is written INSIDE the apply
 * transaction (via {@link BootstrapBackupSkip.writeBootstrapMarker}), so the
 * config writes and the idempotence marker commit or roll back together —
 * there is no crash window in which the config committed but the marker did
 * not. Together with the in-lock re-check, this makes "at most one bootstrap
 * apply ever commits" transactional, not best-effort. (The PIPELINE's own
 * `configuration.imported` audit row is still written after the transaction
 * commits, exactly as on the interactive path; a crash in that narrow window
 * loses only that secondary row — the marker, which idempotence and the probe
 * key on, is already durable.)
