/**
 * #4098: an officer closes a membership subscription charge the invoice worker
 * left in `CONFLICT` / `SUBSCRIPTION_ALREADY_PAID`, because every subscription
 * it covers was paid another way (usually a manual mark-paid). Retry can never
 * clear such a charge: the worker refuses to invoice a PAID subscription.
 *
 * WHAT IT WRITES, in one transaction:
 *
 *  1. The charge, `CONFLICT` -> `NOT_REQUIRED` — the status whose lifecycle
 *     meaning is "this charge needs no invoice and no provider work". `VOIDED`
 *     is not used: it records an invoice Xero voided, and this charge never had
 *     one. Confirmation writes `NOT_REQUIRED` only for a `NO_INVOICE` charge, so
 *     `isChargeClosedAsAlreadyPaid` tells the two apart without a schema change.
 *  2. Every covered subscription must still be settled — `PAID`, or
 *     `NOT_REQUIRED` for an exempt member (owner decision on #4110, 15 Oct
 *     2026); the same guarded write bumps its `voidGeneration`.
 *  3. The charge's ACTIVE coverage claims are released (`releasedAt` set, rows
 *     kept), as the void path does (#2147), each recording the status its
 *     subscription was settled with (`subscriptionStatusAtClose`, #4110 review).
 *  4. An audit row naming the officer, the reason, the charge and the
 *     subscriptions.
 *
 * WHY THE CLAIMS ARE RELEASED. An active claim means "this member's season is
 * billed on this charge", and after the close it is not: it was paid outside
 * the charge. Releasing the claims and bumping `voidGeneration` leaves each
 * subscription exactly as a member marked paid before any billing run (PAID,
 * no invoice link, no active claim). While it stays PAID every preview skips it
 * on status alone. If the manual payment is later reversed, the member is
 * re-billable: no claim hides them from the preview, and the bumped generation
 * gives the new charge a fresh idempotency key. Keeping the claims would leave a
 * reversed member silently unbillable, and without the bump a re-bill would
 * collapse onto this closed charge's key and raise nothing. A PER_FAMILY charge
 * re-bills the same way after a reversal (owner decisions, 15 Oct 2026): the
 * preview keeps counting a closed family charge as billed — a new joiner still
 * meets FAMILY_ALREADY_BILLED — until a covered member's PAYMENT is reversed
 * (PAID at the close, no longer settled), then bills the family again (warning
 * when only some payments were reversed), and the family/type/season unique
 * index covers only live charges (#4110), so the new family charge sits beside
 * this retained row. An exempt member, NOT_REQUIRED at the close, had no
 * payment to reverse: an assignment save or membership sync that later moves
 * them to NOT_INVOICED does not re-bill the family (#4110 review F1).
 *
 * GUARDS AND RACES. No advisory lock, like the void release and the family
 * markers: every write is guarded in its own WHERE. The charge claim is a
 * status-guarded `updateMany` (`CONFLICT` + the code + no invoice), so a double
 * click or two officers close once — the loser waits on the row, then matches
 * nothing and reads the charge already closed. The subscription write matches
 * only settled rows and must touch every one; a manual reversal that committed
 * first makes it fall short and the whole transaction rolls back, and one that
 * arrives later waits on the row and then finds the member re-billable. The
 * close is refused while an invoice operation for the charge is live (queued,
 * running or awaiting payment), chiefly because during a rollout an old pod's
 * worker does not know the closed status at all. Against a new worker the
 * close is safe even without that refusal: every charge-status write the
 * invoice pipeline makes — the enqueue's, the worker's conflict, INVOICE_CREATED,
 * EMAILED and EMAIL_FAILED writes, and the outbox failure handler's — matches
 * only live charges, so none can reopen a closed one. A worker whose Xero call
 * was already in flight when the close landed loses its INVOICE_CREATED write:
 * it links nothing, downgrades nothing, sends no email, and leaves
 * STRAY_INVOICE_AFTER_CLOSE on the closed charge naming the invoice to void. A
 * Retry that loses its status write to a close reports no work. An old pod
 * during a rollout could still process an operation queued concurrently with
 * the close; that is a stated limit.
 *
 * AUDIT SUBJECT. The row names the officer (memberId) and the charge (entity),
 * and lists the covered member ids in its details, but sets no
 * subjectMemberId: that column holds ONE member, so on a family charge it would
 * put the close on one arbitrary member's timeline, and a row per member would
 * multiply one act and widen what members read (INV-PRIV) beyond the decision.
