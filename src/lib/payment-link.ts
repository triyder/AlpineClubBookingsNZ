      AN ENVIRONMENT WITHHOLD IS NOT AN UNDELIVERABLE ADDRESS (#3035 review), and
      bucketing it as `suppressed` was wrong in the most expensive place this
      epic has. The route turns `suppressed` into a 502 reading "your email
      address is undeliverable" — shown to a MEMBER — and it does that on the
      epic's own headline case: a live club upgraded without the declaration.
      The member's address is perfectly fine, the club has just not told the
      software what it is; and the same file already states this rule twenty lines
      above for the unreadable-switch case, where it says in as many words that
      "this address is undeliverable" is misinformation that points an officer at
      the wrong diagnosis.

      So the two faults map to `transient_failure` (503, "try again shortly"),
      which is what they are — they clear the moment a person corrects the
      deployment — and the confirmed COPY maps to `withheld`, which is the
      deliberate, non-transient bucket. Neither tells a member anything untrue
      about their own mailbox.
