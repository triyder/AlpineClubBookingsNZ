        THE CLAIM ABOVE IS THE ONLY THING THAT WILL EVER SELECT THIS BOOKING
        (#3035). It stamps `preArrivalReminderSentAt` BEFORE the send, and the
        query's own filter is `preArrivalReminderSentAt: null` — so a stamp
        written for a message that never went out is consumed permanently. This
        message carries the door code and the arrival instructions, so the
        member arrives at a locked lodge and nothing anywhere says why.

        `sendEmail` RETURNS rather than throws when nothing was transmitted, so
        the `catch` below never saw any of these. The same rule as the
        additional-payment reminder: hand the stamp back unless something else
        will replay the message.

        The confirmed-copy withhold is terminal (a `SKIPPED_NON_PRODUCTION` row,
        nothing to retry), so it KEEPS the stamp — a copy must not re-claim and
        re-suppress the same booking every run, which would write a new counted
        row per pass and make an idle staging box read like a live club whose
        mail is being held. Every other non-send hands the stamp back, because
        every one of them is something a person can fix: declare the role, correct
        the transport flags, clear a suppression, replace a walk-in placeholder
        address, turn the booking's switch back off.

          `FAILED` EmailLog row for the email retry cron to pick up. This template

        member. And `pre-arrival-reminder` is one of the templates whose rendered
        body is deliberately NOT retained (it carries a door code), so the email
        retry cron can never replay the FAILED row it leaves behind. Without this
        the stamp stays and the reminder is gone for good.

        The trade accepted, stated: if a provider accepted the message and then
        dropped the connection, the next run sends a second reminder. A duplicate
        pre-arrival note is a much smaller harm than a member arriving at a locked
        lodge with no door code, and it is the same trade the additional-payment
        reminder already makes.
