/**
 * Group bookings — ORGANISER_PAYS settlement collection.
 *
 * The organiser of an ORGANISER_PAYS group settles every joiner's child booking
 * as one combined bill. Each child booking was created PAYMENT_PENDING and
 * flagged `organiserSettled`, so the joiner is never billed and cannot pay it.
 *
 * Settlement reuses the existing pay-on-account semantics (issue #709):
 *
 *   1. When the organiser starts a settlement, the children are committed to
 *      CONFIRMED under the same advisory lock as every other creation path. A
 *      CONFIRMED booking holds capacity, so the beds are reserved the moment the
 *      organiser commits to pay — exactly like a school group's emailed invoice.
 *      The capacity claim is all-or-nothing: if any child no longer fits, no
 *      child is committed and no money is taken, and the organiser is told who
 *      could not be placed so they can remove them and retry.
 *   2. A single Stripe PaymentIntent for the combined total is created and
 *      recorded on GroupBookingSettlement.
 *   3. On `payment_intent.succeeded` (webhook, type=group_settlement) the
 *      children flip CONFIRMED -> PAID exactly once. Because the beds were
 *      already held at CONFIRMED there is no second capacity race and no refund
 *      path: the combined charge simply settles bookings whose beds are secured.
 *
 * Conventions match group-booking.ts: integer cents, NZ date-only booking dates,
 * Stripe/Xero calls run outside the database transaction.
