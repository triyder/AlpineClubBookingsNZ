/**
 * Historical Xero invoice rounding-drift audit (issue #1318, read-only).
 *
 * PR #1231 fixed issue #1163: before it, `buildInvoiceLineItems` grouped a
 * guest's nights into contiguous **date** runs only (issue #713) and billed each
 * run as `quantity: nightCount, unitAmount: round(totalCents / nightCount) / 100`.
 * When a single contiguous run mixed nightly prices (a season boundary, or
 * locked-vs-re-priced nights), `nightCount * round(totalCents / nightCount)` could
 * not represent the exact cent total, so the issued Xero invoice's guest-line
 * total drifted 1–2 cents from the true ledger. The same rounding also bit the
 * legacy no-per-night path whenever `guest.priceCents` was not divisible by the
 * night count. #1231 split every run to a single price so the lines reconcile by
 * construction — but it did NOT retroactively heal invoices already issued.
 *
 * This module is a **diagnostic only**. It replays the pre-#1231 line maths over
 * persisted booking/guest/night data — entirely in integer cents — and flags
 * issued invoices whose guest-line total would have drifted. It makes ZERO live
 * provider calls (no Xero, no Stripe), opens no transactions, and mutates
 * nothing. See `scripts/audit-xero-invoice-rounding.ts` for the operator CLI and
 * `docs/xero/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the fresh-install / fork stance.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: a flag means "this booking's data would have produced a drifting
 * line total under the pre-#1231 builder." It does NOT prove the live Xero
 * invoice is still wrong: the invoice may have been issued after #1231 was
 * deployed (already correct), or since voided/credited/superseded. Operators
 * must confirm against Xero before treating a flag as a real accounting error.
