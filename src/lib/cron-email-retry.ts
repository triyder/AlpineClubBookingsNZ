    Environment-safety boundary (#3035, ENV-SAFETY 2; epic #2986). INV-CONFIG-004.

    This job used to build its own nodemailer transport, which is exactly why the
    epic could not simply add a check to `sendEmail`: a replay never passed
    through that function at all. It now asks the same policy and obtains its
    transport through the same clearance-gated accessor, so there is one boundary
    rather than two.

    THE TWO NON-SEND ANSWERS ARE DIFFERENT SHAPES ON PURPOSE.

    A confirmed copy returns cleanly with nothing retried. It is not a fault — a
    copy declining to replay the club's mail is the job working — and throwing
    every thirty minutes would fill a staging copy's cron history with red runs
    that mean nothing.

    A CONFIGURATION FAULT THROWS. Both remaining answers are one: an undeclared
    installation, and a live site that has declared a capture mailbox.

    A DECLARED CAPTURE COPY REPLAYS NORMALLY, into the capture. That is the one
    case where a copy legitimately transmits, and it is what lets the browser
    suite exercise this job at all.

    NEITHER TOUCHES A ROW, and that is the part worth being careful about. The
    rows are left exactly as found, so no attempt is burned and no retained body
    is dropped: the moment the role is declared, the very next run replays them.
    Marking them instead would have been the tempting shortcut and it destroys
    information — a copy restored from the club's live database holds the live
    site's genuinely-failed rows, and rewriting those as "held back by this copy"
    would both lie about their history and inflate the withheld count that #3034's
    panel reads.

    THE CLEARANCE IS RE-RESOLVED PER MESSAGE, NOT ONCE PER RUN (#3071 review,
    hoppers99). This job used to resolve the policy here and obtain one
    transporter for the whole batch, so a single check covered up to fifty
    messages: an administrator who switched the safer override on mid-run stopped
    `sendEmail` immediately but let every remaining queued retry go to real
    members. Two docblocks shipped in #3035 described per-message protection this
    job did not have.

    That was recorded during our own review as "a bounded limit worth stating
    rather than fixing", and that was the wrong call. The override exists so an
    operator can stop mail NOW — it is the click somebody makes the moment they
    realise a copy is about to email the club's real members — so "it takes effect
    on the next batch" is not a limit, it is the feature not working.

    WHAT IT COSTS: one primary-key read of a one-row table per message, twice
    (`resolveDeliveryPolicy` here and `requireDeliveryClearance` inside
    `getEmailTransporter`), bounded by the batch of fifty. `sendEmail` already
    pays the same per message. The transporter itself is CACHED on its
    configuration signature, so no connection is rebuilt.

    THE TWO READS ARE BOTH KEPT ON PURPOSE. Asking the policy directly is what
    preserves the two SHAPES this job established at the top of the run — a
    confirmed copy stops cleanly, a configuration fault throws — which
    `getEmailTransporter` alone cannot express, because it throws for every
    non-allow answer and would turn a correct operator action into a red cron run.
    Getting the transport through the clearance-gated accessor is what keeps the
    compile-time guarantee that no sender reaches a provider without asking. See
    the loop below.

              or a live site in capture mode — and `deliveryBlockReason` was
              written nowhere else and cleared nowhere at all. So once an operator
              repaired the configuration and the replay then hit a genuine provider
              failure, the row kept the stale block reason for the life of the
              installation: counted forever by
              `readWithheldApplicationEmail`, which selects
              `FAILED` + `deliveryBlockReason NOT NULL`. Admin -> Environment would
              go on telling a healthy live club it was holding mail back, which
              breaks owner decision 1 — the count has to DRAIN after the repair,
              because a count that never drains cannot distinguish anything.

              It also falsifies the column's own documented contract in
              `schema.prisma` ("NULL for … a genuine transport failure") and
              INV-CONFIG-004's promise that a safety block is distinguishable from a
              transport failure by more than a message string. This write is now
              exactly that: a transport failure, so the reason is NULL and the
              message string is the provider's.
