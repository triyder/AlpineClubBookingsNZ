/**
 * Group bookings — organiser-cancel cleanup.
 *
 * When the organiser cancels their host booking, the existing cancel path
 * (booking-cancel.ts) cancels and refunds the organiser's *own* booking and any
 * linked provisional (PENDING) non-member child. That leaves a gap for groups:
 *
 *   - EACH_PAYS_OWN joiners own and pay their own independent child bookings, so
 *     they are intentionally left intact; we only close the group to new joins.
 *
 *   - ORGANISER_PAYS joiners rely entirely on the organiser to settle. Their
 *     child bookings are never PENDING (they are PAYMENT_PENDING, then CONFIRMED
 *     once the organiser commits to settle, then PAID), so the PENDING-only
 *     cleanup never touches them. Cancelling the organiser would otherwise strand
 *     them: CONFIRMED beds keep holding lodge capacity with the payer gone, and
 *     nothing can ever be settled. This module cancels those children, releases
 *     their beds, and — for a group that was already settled — refunds the
 *     organiser.
 *
 * The settlement is a single Stripe PaymentIntent for the combined total, so the
 * refund is one Stripe refund. The refund amount follows the *same* date-based
 * cancellation policy as the organiser's own booking and every normal booking
 * (calculateRefundAmount), applied per paid child so each child's Xero refund
 * credit note (allocated against that child's own settlement invoice) sums
 * exactly to the single Stripe refund.
 *
 * Conventions match group-booking.ts: integer cents, NZ date-only booking dates,
 * Stripe/Xero calls run outside the database transaction. Everything here is
 * best-effort and idempotent: the Stripe refund carries an idempotency key, the
 * settlement guards on its own status, and already-CANCELLED children are skipped
 * by the status filter, so a re-run never double-refunds or double-cancels.
 *
 * Re-drivability (#1236): the first run persists the per-child refund plan
 * ({childId: cents}) on the settlement BEFORE the Stripe refund and BEFORE the
 * settlement flips to REFUNDED/PARTIALLY_REFUNDED. A crash-interrupted re-drive
 * (the group-settlement-reaper resume phase re-invokes this function)
 * reconstructs that plan verbatim rather than recomputing it: the per-child
 * refundedAmountCents mirror is the record of record for these organiser-settled
 * refunds, and daysUntilDate can land in a different cancellation tier on a >24h
 * re-drive, so recomputing the mirror amount would be unsafe.
 *
 * Refund durability (F3, #1351, owner-decided auto-retry): a durable recovery
 * operation is enqueued BEFORE the inline Stripe refund (the #1349
 * enqueue-then-execute pattern, delayed so the cron only claims it when this
 * run failed or died) and marked SUCCEEDED after the flip. A transient Stripe
 * failure no longer abandons the organiser's refund: the persisted plan is
 * KEPT frozen, the children are still cancelled (beds must release now) with
 * their refund mirrors deferred, and executeGroupSettlementRefundPlan replays
 * the refund under the same `group_cancel_refund_<settlementId>` key, flips
 * the settlement, applies the per-child mirrors idempotently (only for
 * already-CANCELLED plan children whose mirror is still zero — ACTIVE
 * children stay owned by the reaper resume path), and enqueues their Xero
 * credit notes. Admins are alerted only when the recovery retries exhaust.
 *
 * Credit-note durability (F21 #3, #1257/#1377): the inline per-child refund
 * credit-note enqueue is a DB outbox insert, so it now commits INSIDE the same
 * transaction as the child cancel + refund mirror (store: tx). A crash can no
 * longer strand a CANCELLED child with its mirror written but no credit-note
 * operation queued — the drift is closed for every source, including
 * Internet-Banking children the #1354 daily reconcile self-heal cannot recover
 * (they carry no per-child xeroInvoiceId). A resume/replay never re-derives
 * money; it only completes an interrupted cleanup.

/**
 * Replay an organiser-cancel settlement refund from the settlement's
 * PERSISTED refund plan (F3, #1351). Invoked by the payment-recovery cron for
 * `group_settlement_refund_recovery_<settlementId>` operations after the
 * inline refund failed or the process died mid-cancel.
 *
 * Frozen-tier contract: the plan is applied VERBATIM — this function never
 * calls calculateRefundAmount, so a >24h retry can never land in a different
 * cancellation tier than the one recorded at cancel time.
 *
 * Idempotency:
 * - The Stripe refund reuses the inline `group_cancel_refund_<settlementId>`
 *   key, so an ambiguous inline failure (Stripe refunded, response lost) is
 *   answered with the original refund, never repeated.
 * - The settlement flip is guarded on SUCCEEDED; a crash-after-flip replay
 *   lands in the already_refunded branch and only completes the mirrors.
 * - Per-child refundedAmountCents mirrors are applied only to plan children
 *   whose booking is already CANCELLED (the inline loop is done with them)
 *   and whose mirror is still zero, via a conditional updateMany — so this
 *   can never double-apply against the inline loop or the #1236 reaper
 *   resume path, which own ACTIVE children.
 * - Xero credit-note enqueues are deduplicated by the outbox (watermark /
 *   canonical-note logic), keyed off the mirror written just before.
 *
 * Throws on Stripe failure so the recovery machinery applies backoff and
 * alerts only when retries exhaust (owner decision, 2026-07-06).
