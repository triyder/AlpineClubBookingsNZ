/**
 * Membership financial-year configuration.
 *
 * The club's financial year-end month drives how a calendar date maps to a
 * membership "season year" and how the Xero subscription-invoice window is
 * built. The effective value is resolved on the server (override, else the
 * connected Xero organisation, else the March default) and cached here as a
 * plain module-level number.
 *
 * This module deliberately has NO server imports (no Prisma, no Xero). It is
 * imported transitively by `utils.ts`, which is also pulled into client
 * bundles, so the synchronous getter below must stay dependency-free. The
 * async resolution lives in `financial-year-server.ts`.
