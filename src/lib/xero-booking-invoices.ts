 *
 * Card-gated for three reasons: (1) Internet-Banking invoices allocate via their own
 * fire-after outbox op (#1620) — running it here would double-drive them; (2) a card
 * invoice is only raised after capture (payment SUCCEEDED); (3) a legacy full-price
 * capture carries `creditAppliedCents = 0` (its mirror was never credit-reduced) and

 * double-pay is repaired by a LOCAL credit restore, not a Xero note (which cannot
 * refund cash already sent). Dynamic import avoids a load-order cycle (mirrors
 * xero-operation-retry's engine import).
 *
 * THROWS on allocation failure so the caller fails the invoice sync op and the retry
 * re-drives the idempotent engine — the invoice is never re-created (the
 * `xeroInvoiceId` short-circuit at the top of createXeroInvoiceForBooking), and the

      raised on the live site, so nothing here had ever looked at what its
      contact holds — and Xero emails invoice reminders for an outstanding
      AUTHORISED invoice from its own servers, to whatever address that contact
      holds.

      IT RUNS HERE, below the invoice read, because the contact this update
      re-sends is `currentInvoice.contact` — not the member's link, which can be a
      different contact after a merge or an admin re-link. The first version of
      this check ran at the top of the function against the member's link and
