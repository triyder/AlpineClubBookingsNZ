/**
 * Operational AI help assistant configuration — DB-only resolution (#2211,
 * epic #2094 C3).
 *
 * The Anthropic API key lives ONLY in the encrypted IntegrationCredential store
 * (C1, #2079) under provider "anthropic", key "api_key". There is no
 * `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var read for operation — the key is entered in-app on
 * Admin → Integrations and resolved async (a DB fetch, cache-backed by
 * integration-credentials.ts).
 *
 * Exposure contract (#2079): the API key is NEVER returned to a client, logged,
 * or put in an audit row. Setup surfaces read metadata-only state. The key is
 * the highest-privilege secret in this lane — it authorises paid model spend —
 * so it is treated exactly like the Stripe secret key.
 *
 * Deliberate asymmetry vs googleLogin (epic decision): the module toggle has NO
 * enable-gate on a present/verified key. googleLogin locks until a real OAuth
 * round-trip verifies because an unconfigured Google provider renders a visibly
 * broken sign-in path; the AI assistant instead degrades to a structured
 * "not_configured" fallback at the /api/help/chat route, so enabling the module
 * without a key is harmless (curated page help still works). No verify-ping
 * endpoint is shipped (cut per plan option).
