/**
 * Tokens an override may not drop from the SUBJECT LINE (#2774).
 *
 * WHY THIS TABLE HAS TO EXIST AT ALL, AND WHY IT IS SEPARATE FROM
 * `REQUIRED_TEMPLATE_TOKENS`. That table is deliberately body-only, and says so:
 * required tokens are body CONTENT (a door code, a pay link), and a token sitting
 * in the subject was never allowed to satisfy the requirement. That is right for
 * content — but it left a real hole for a template whose subject has to state
 * WHICH WAY something went, because `prepareEmailMessage` replaces the sender's
 * computed subject with a stored override unconditionally and nothing checked what
 * the override said.
 *
 * The `admin-late-capture-hand-back-conflict` alert is the case that forced it. It
 * is sent in two opposite directions — a refund the system WITHHELD, or one that
 * may have paid a member TWICE — and the subject is the triage surface: an operator
 * who files by subject files a suspected double payment as "nothing to do". With a
 * direction written into `defaultSubject` as literal text, every double-payment
 * notice would have arrived titled "Automatic refund withheld" from the moment any
 * admin pressed Save on the Email Messages form, untouched. The direction therefore
 * rides in the subject as `{{handBackConflictLabel}}`, and this table is what stops
 * an admin editing it back out. The body's own `{{handBackConflictNote}}` requirement
 * is unchanged and independent — the two fields are protected separately because
 * either one alone can be read as the whole message.
 *
 * KEEP THIS TABLE SMALL. A subject token is a poor place for content, so the bar is
 * the one this entry meets: the mail is sent in more than one direction from ONE
 * template, and a subject asserting the wrong direction would be read as a
 * statement about money. Anything less belongs in `REQUIRED_TEMPLATE_TOKENS`.

/**
 * Wording an override may not put IN the subject of a template whose subject has to
 * state which way money went (#2774, second half).
 *
 * WHY REQUIRING THE TOKEN WAS NOT ENOUGH. `REQUIRED_SUBJECT_TEMPLATE_TOKENS` above
 * refuses a subject that DROPS `{{handBackConflictLabel}}`. It says nothing about a
 * subject that KEEPS it and types a direction beside it — "Automatic refund withheld
 * - {{handBackConflictLabel}}: {{memberName}}" satisfied every check and renders, on
 * the double-payment arm, as "Automatic refund withheld - Payment may have been
 * refunded TWICE - reconcile: Alice Example". The leading words are the ones an inbox
 * truncates to, so the mail that says money may have gone out twice arrives titled as
 * one that did not go out at all. Prepending a phrase to a pre-populated subject is an
 * ordinary admin edit, and the obvious phrase to reach for is the wording of the last
 * such email they received.
 *
 * DERIVED FROM THE LABELS, NOT RE-TYPED. The clauses come from
 * `lateCaptureHandBackConflictSubjectLabel` itself, split on its em dash, so rewording
 * an arm moves this table with it and the two cannot drift. Single-word clauses are
 * dropped ("reconcile" is a topic, not a claim, and an admin may legitimately write
 * "Reconcile a late capture"), and the two decisive direction WORDS are added back
 * explicitly because "Refund withheld - {{handBackConflictLabel}}" is the same defect
 * in fewer words. `email-message-notes.ts` is the single source for both, and
 * `admin-late-capture-hand-back-conflict-alert.test.ts` pins every phrase here to
 * exactly one arm, so a phrase that stops being one arm's wording fails there.
 *
 * SCOPE, STATED HONESTLY: this catches the shipped wordings and their obvious short
 * forms, not every possible paraphrase. A free-text subject cannot be made
 * paraphrase-proof; the guarantee that does not depend on the admin's wording is the
 * BODY, which states the direction four times over required tokens of its own.
