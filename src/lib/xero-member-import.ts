/**
 * Cached-contact import from configured Xero contact groups.
 *
 * Reads `XeroContactCache` + `XeroContactGroupMembershipCache` (populated
 * by xero-bulk-contact-sync and xero-contact-groups) and creates local
 * `Member` rows for contacts in each mapped group. Falls back to a live
 * Xero fetch only when the caller opts in via `allowLiveXeroFetch`.
 *
 * #2108: each group mapping may additionally carry a `membershipTypeId`. When
 * it does, the import writes a current-season `SeasonalMembershipAssignment`
 * for the contact (source `IMPORT`, sourceDetail = group name). Newly-created
 * members are batched via `createMany`; matched-EXISTING members are routed
 * through `saveSeasonalMembershipAssignment` so the age-exemption force,
 * shared-double sweep, and per-member audit apply.
 *
 * Never-overwrite invariant: an existing current-season assignment is NEVER
 * replaced (remediation is the bulk-assign tool). That is enforced by the
 * PRE-READ skip below — matched-existing members who already hold a
 * current-season assignment are filtered out and reported before any save runs
 * (the preview token-staleness 409 in `saveSeasonalMembershipAssignment` is a
 * backstop for a race). The save path itself upserts by design, so it must only
 * ever be reached for members with no current-season assignment.
 *
 * Scale tradeoff: matched-existing members are assigned in a sequential loop,
 * one `saveSeasonalMembershipAssignment` call each (preview + save + per-member
 * Xero contact-group sync fan-out). For a very large tenant importing thousands
 * of already-linked members this is O(n) round-trips; it is the accepted interim
 * posture (see the #2107-rebase TODO at the save call site for the batched
 * reconcile that supersedes the per-member fan-out).
