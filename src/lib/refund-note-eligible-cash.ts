/**
 * THE CASH A REFUND CREDIT NOTE MAY ANSWER (#3635 round-3 R1, `INV-PAY-110`).
 *
 * The one figure every refund-note sizing and gap reads: the enqueue's cap
 * (`enqueueXeroRefundCreditNoteOperation`), the note's execution-time cap
 * (`createXeroCreditNote`), the refund-gap reader behind the self-heal list and
 * the booking page (`readRefundCreditNoteGap`), the hardening report's
 * over-coverage count, and the refund-note link-repair script's coverage
 * target (`xero-refund-note-link-repair.ts`, #3635 C3). It is the payment's provider-backed CASH refund evidence
 * (`resolveStripeCashRefundEvidence`, #2902) LESS the refunds of late captures
 * the app never recorded in Xero.
 *
 * WHY. A late capture on a cancelled booking is a receipt Xero does not hold
 * until the app records it (`readLateCaptureXeroReceipt`): refunded before
 * then - on a treasurer's approval, after a withdrawal, in the dashboard and
 * then closed, or automatically by the webhook - it deliberately gets no note,
 * because the note's Stripe-account refund payment would take out money that
 * never went in. Counted as ordinary cash, that deliberate gap read as a
 * missing note, and the nightly self-heal raised it 24 hours later against the
 * booking's cleared pre-cancel invoice. A receipt resolved by hand is excluded
 * too: its refunds are recorded by hand, and the repair tool says so.
 *
 * Refund rows are matched to their capture by `PaymentRefund.stripePaymentIntentId`;
 * which intents are late captures is `findLateCapturePaymentIntents`, plus
 * (#4170), on a cancelled booking, any capture that landed after the cancel
 * (`findCapturesLandedAfterCancellation`) while it has no record row yet. A
 * pre-ledger payment (no `PaymentRefund` rows) predates late-capture holds and
 * is left to the evidence's legacy rule.
