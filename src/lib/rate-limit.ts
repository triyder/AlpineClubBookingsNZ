 * The shape the upsert below actually RETURNS, checked at runtime (#2289).
 *
 * This is the one raw statement in `src/` whose result is read and which cannot
 * be expressed through a Prisma model — the whole point is the atomic
 * `CASE ... RETURNING` upsert, which restarts an expired window and increments a
 * live one in a single statement with no read-modify-write race. So it keeps its
 * raw SQL and gets a decoder instead: a renamed or retyped column now throws
 * naming itself, rather than yielding `undefined` and letting `Number(undefined)`
 * become `NaN` — under which `NaN > config.limit` is false and EVERY request is
 * allowed. A rate limiter that silently stops limiting is the exact failure this
 * class produces, and the fallback below would never see it, because there is no
 * error to catch.
 *
 * `count` is an `int4` column, so it arrives as a number; `rawIntColumn` also
 * accepts the BigInt a future `COUNT(*)`-style rewrite would return.
 *
 * WHERE THE THROW LANDS, deliberately: inside the existing `try`, so a shape
 * mismatch is treated as exactly what it is — the shared store failing to answer
 * usefully — and the request drops to the per-process fallback, with the error
 * logged. That keeps the limiter's standing decision that a store-local fault
 * must not become a login outage, while still turning a mismatch into a visible
 * error instead of a silent `NaN` that waves everything through.
 *
 * BE PRECISE ABOUT WHAT THE FALLBACK BUYS, because it is easy to over-read.
 * `degraded: true` only *reduces* the budget for `authSensitive` limiters
 * (`checkRateLimitInMemory` above); for the majority — `api`, `bookingQuery`,
 * `bookingCreate`, the member-guest resolve/search/add-probe throttles,
 * `dataExport`, `deletionRequest`, the group-booking limiters — the degraded
 * budget IS the full budget, now counted per process. And a shape mismatch is
 * PERMANENT, not a blip: every call throws until the schema is fixed, so a
 * two-replica deployment enforces each of those budgets twice over, with the
 * window resetting on every restart. That is still strictly better than what it
 * replaces (`Number(undefined)` → `NaN`, under which `NaN > limit` is false and
 * every request is allowed, forever, silently), which is why the throw belongs
 * here rather than outside the `try` — but the fallback is a floor, not a fix.
 * The `RawSqlShapeError` travels in `err` to the logger and to Sentry naming the
 * column, so the fix is the alert, not the fallback.

 *
 *  - one household behind a single NAT — a family all booking from the lodge's

 *
 * The member key closes the second hole outright. The first is closed by SIZING
 * rather than by dropping the IP check: the shared key carries
 * `MEMBER_SCOPED_IP_LIMIT_MULTIPLIER` times the per-member budget, so a NAT full
 * of honest members never reaches it and a single address behaving like ten
 * members still does. Both keys are namespaced (`ip:` / `member:`) so a member id

 * can cost a member-keyed write.

   * CROSS-FAMILY member-guest add attempts on the booking add paths (#2388):
   * 15 per 15 minutes and 50 per day, per acting member.
   *
   * THE OWNER'S 31 JUL DECISION, and the reason it is a separate limiter rather
   * than a tightening of `bookingQuery`: the channel #2388 describes is a run of
   * quote/create attempts naming ONE other member across many dates, from which
   * the pattern of refusals maps the nights that member is already booked. So
   * this limiter counts only the attempts that actually name a beyond-family
   * member, which means an ordinary family booking — the overwhelming majority,
   * forever — is not rate-limited by it at all, however many times the booker
   * changes their dates.
   *
   * THE SIZING, STATED HONESTLY — corrected by the privacy review (finding M2),
   * which caught this docblock overstating what it buys by a factor of about
   * seven. Fifty cross-family attempts a day is NOT "three weeks to map a
   * season": a lodge season is roughly 150 nights, so at 50 a day a single
   * member's season is mapped in about three days, and a whole year in about
   * seven and a half. What the cap actually does is turn an afternoon's scripted
   * run into days of patient work that leaves up to 50 audit rows a day naming
   * the prober and their target — while an honest booker, who would struggle to
   * exceed fifteen cross-family quote attempts in a sitting, never notices it.
   *
   * Closing the residual entirely would need an automatic block on repeated
   * refusals, which the owner explicitly rejected on #2388: the innocent case
   * (hunting for a date that suits a friend) is indistinguishable from the
   * probing one, and only a person can tell them apart.
   *
   * It is a THROTTLE, not the "cap or block on repeated refusals" the owner
   * explicitly rejected: it counts attempts (successful and refused alike), it
   * is not keyed on the target, it clears itself, and it never turns into a
   * permanent refusal. See `member-guest-probe-guard.ts`.
