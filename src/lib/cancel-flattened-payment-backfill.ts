// defect (#1473 / #1506).
//
// Before PR #1489, `cancelBooking`'s not-SUCCEEDED branch overwrote EVERY
// payment's aggregate `status` to FAILED — including captured
// (PARTIALLY_)REFUNDED payments — while leaving `refundedAmountCents` and the
// PaymentTransaction ledger untouched. #1489 stopped the overwrite going
// forward, but rows already flattened are not backfilled. The read path is
// already correct (the repair pass synthesizes captured state from the STRIPE
// mirror / ledger); this restores the STORED aggregate status for cleanliness.
//
// Pure local DB repair: no Xero, Stripe, SES, or Sentry calls; money stays in
// integer cents; only the flattened `status` field is touched.

 *  - the aggregate `status` is FAILED (the flatten target — the old code only
 *    ever wrote `status: "FAILED"`; it never touched `refundedAmountCents` or
 *    the ledger), and
 *  - the payment has capture evidence per the #1489 discriminator, and
 *  - the restored captured status the read path already synthesizes differs
 *    from the stored FAILED.
 *
 * The restored status reuses the exact #1489 repair-pass synthesis
 * (`applyLegacyRefundStatus`) with base SUCCEEDED — capture evidence proves the
 * payment captured, so its base state is SUCCEEDED and any refund history in
 * the intact `refundedAmountCents` mirror re-derives PARTIALLY_REFUNDED /
 * REFUNDED. Because the mirror is untouched by the flatten, this is exactly
