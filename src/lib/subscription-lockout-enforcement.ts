/**
 * The ONE place the five booking write paths ask "what does this club's
 * subscription-lockout policy say about this party?" (#2543).
 *
 * The five paths are `POST /api/bookings`, `POST /api/bookings/[id]/confirm-draft`,
 * `POST /api/bookings/[id]/modify-quote`, `POST /api/bookings/[id]/guests`, and
 * the group-booking join in `group-booking.ts`. Each keeps its own
 * already-reviewed HARD_BLOCK refusal (they differ in shape — one returns a
 * `NextResponse`, one throws `ApiError`, one throws `GroupBookingError` — and
 * rewriting four working refusals to share a fifth shape would be churn with
 * risk and no gain). What they must NOT each own is the NEW behaviour, so
 * everything `NON_MEMBER_PRICING` adds lives here and is called identically from
 * all five.
 *
 * Division of labour with the rest of the #2543 stack:
 *
 *  - `member-subscription-eligibility.ts` resolves the club's MODE;
 *  - `subscription-lockout-facts.ts` answers "does this member owe?";
 *  - `policies/subscription-lockout-pricing.ts` is the pure RULE and the
 *    member-facing wording;
 *  - `membership-type-policy.ts` applies the reprice at the single pricing gate;
 *  - THIS module loads the party's live facts and turns the rule into the
 *    refusal, the notice, and the exception-eligible violation.
 *
 * It deliberately performs the paid-up-adult test and nothing about pricing: the
 * price is already guaranteed by the pricing gate, and a second, parallel
 * computation of the same money here is exactly the drift #2543 removes.

  /**
   * The frozen, exception-eligible violation when this party owes a paid-up adult
   * member and has none; null otherwise. A caller that receives one MUST refuse

   *
   * THE REQUIREMENT HAS TWO TRIGGERS, and it is still not unconditional. It fires
   * when somebody STAYING on this party is being repriced for an unpaid
   * subscription, and — owner decision, 3 Aug 2026 — when the BOOKING OWNER is an
   * unfinancial member, whether or not they stay.
   *
   * THE FIRST TRIGGER is the owner's original rule about the unpaid member: "they
   * get charged non-member rates, and there still has to be at least one paid-up
   * adult member on the booking".
   *
   * THE SECOND TRIGGER WAS ADDED DELIBERATELY, over the objection this comment
   * used to record. The objection was that `NON_MEMBER_PRICING` is a RELAXATION of
   * the hard block and must not newly refuse bookings that are legal today, and it
   * is still why the requirement is not applied to every booking: a paid-up Youth
   * member booking their own bed, a family booking whose only member row is a
   * child, and an all-non-member party are all untouched by either trigger. But
   * the reasoning had a hole, and it was the wrong one to leave open. HARD_BLOCK
   * refuses an unfinancial member AS A PERSON — they cannot book at all, even for
   * a party of non-members they will not join. Keyed only on who stays, the
   * relaxed mode let exactly that booking through with no reprice, no requirement
   * and no notice, so switching a club to the softer rule quietly opened the one
   * case the strict rule most reliably closed, and lapsing would have cost a
   * member nothing so long as they booked for others.
   *
   * SO THE REQUIREMENT FOLLOWS THE UNFINANCIAL MEMBER, not only their bed. In that
   * case it is still gentler than HARD_BLOCK rather than stricter: a flat 403
   * becomes a 409 with an override door and the beds held, so a booking a Booking
   * Officer is willing to approve can proceed. An unfinancial owner can never
   * satisfy their own requirement — they fail the money half of
   * `participantIsPaidUpAdultMember` — and a paid-up adult member in the PARTY
   * satisfies it exactly as before, which is what keeps the intended family case
   * working: the financial spouse is on the booking, so it books.
   *
   * "Is there a responsible adult member present?" in the GENERAL case remains the
   * adult-member-hosting policy's question (#2364), which a club configures per
   * lodge and which composes with this one; this stays the narrow
   * financial-integrity guard on the money mode.
   *
   * THE FROZEN VIOLATION SHAPE IS UNCHANGED by the second trigger. `requirements`
   * still carries counts and no identities, and it must keep both counts: the
   * officer's snapshot is hashed from them (`booking-exception-requests.ts` folds
   * `repriced=` and `party=` into the open-state fingerprint), so redacting them
   * here would change which refusals count as "the same hazard".
   *
   * WHAT THE COUNTS DISCLOSE, AND TO WHOM. An owner-triggered refusal reads
   * `repricedUnpaidMemberCount: 0`, so it says the trigger was NOT a member of the
   * party. On ten of the eleven sites that is a fact the recipient already holds,
   * because the unfinancial member IS the recipient: create, quote, confirm-draft,
   * modify-quote, guest-add, the modify apply path and both waitlist confirms all
   * run for the booking's own owner, an admin is exempt from the whole check, and
   * the group-join gate passes the JOINER as the owner of the booking they are
   * making (`group-booking.ts`), not the group booking's owner.
   *
   * THE ELEVENTH SITE IS THE EXCEPTION, and it is why the RESPONSE body is
   * audience-scoped rather than the violation. `removeBookingGuestInTransaction`
   * lets a member take their OWN guest row off somebody else's booking, so there
   * the refusal can be delivered to a member of another family while the trigger
   * is the booking OWNER's unpaid subscription — a member who can see that
   * person's financial standing nowhere else in the app. Pre-#2543-owner-decision
   * the same refusal could only fire with `repricedUnpaidMemberCount >= 1`, i.e.
   * about the party, never about the owner. So `buildPaidUpAdultRefusalBody` takes
   * an `audience`, and the removal path asks for `"OTHER_PARTY_MEMBER"` when the
   * actor does not own the booking, which the route answers with
   * `buildPaidUpAdultRefusalBodyForOtherPartyMember`: same refusal, same override
   * door, without the field that distinguishes the two triggers.
