/**
 * Xero webhook intent-to-receive (ITR) receipt sink + freshness-scoped verify
 * (#2081, C3).
 *
 * Xero validates a new webhook subscription with an "intent to receive" request:
 * a POST whose body carries an EMPTY `events: []` array, signed with the webhook
 * signing key. The receiver must echo a 200 when the HMAC matches (401
 * otherwise). Because the per-event inbound-event recorder only runs inside the
 * per-event loop, a valid ITR ping would otherwise leave NO observable trace —
 * so the setup wizard could never prove the round-trip worked.
 *
 * This module is that observable trace: on a valid-signature empty-events POST
 * the webhook route records a marker (one row per provider) stamped with the
 * receipt time AND a non-reversible fingerprint of the webhook key that signed
 * it. The wizard then polls a verify endpoint that goes green ONLY when:
 *
 *   1. a marker exists whose `keyFingerprint` matches the CURRENTLY stored
 *      webhook key (so a marker recorded under a previous/replaced key can never
 *      satisfy a new verify — replacing the key re-arms verification), AND
 *   2. that marker's `validatedAt` is strictly newer than the operator's
 *      server-issued verify-start instant (so a stale marker from an EARLIER
 *      verification can never satisfy a fresh verify — the green state always
 *      corresponds to a live round-trip the operator just triggered).
 *
 * PRODUCTION-PARITY: the marker is written by the real `/api/webhooks/xero`
 * route after its real `getOperationalXeroWebhookKey()` resolve + HMAC check, so
 * a green verify provably exercises the same resolver/HMAC path production uses.
 *
 * EXPOSURE CONTRACT (#2079): the webhook key is NEVER stored or returned here —
 * only its SHA-256 fingerprint is persisted, and only booleans/timestamps leave
 * the server.
