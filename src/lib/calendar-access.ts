/**
 * Write access to the club events calendar (#calendar).
 *
 * Access is deliberately ASYMMETRIC — CREATE is broader than EDIT/DELETE — and
 * the server, not the UI, is the authority (see docs/guides/calendar.md → "Who
 * can do what"):
 *
 * - **Create** (`canManageCalendarEvents`): **Full Admins** (merged permission
 *   matrix grants `lodge:edit`) OR **committee members** — any member holding at
 *   least one ACTIVE `CommitteeAssignment` under an ACTIVE `CommitteeRole`.
 *   Committee assignment normally grants NO app privileges (it is public contact
 *   metadata, see CONFIGURATION.md → Committee Settings); letting committee
 *   members *add* events is the one deliberate exception, so they can post
 *   meetings without being made Full Admins.
 * - **Edit / delete** (`canEditCalendarEvents`): **Full Admins only**
 *   (`lodge:edit`). Committee members are create-only: they may NOT edit or
 *   delete events — not even their own, and never another admin's series. This
 *   is why edit/delete gates on the admin leg alone and does not consult the
 *   committee table.
 *
 * Everyone else who can log in is read-only. The gate is enforced server-side in
 * every calendar write route. The UI mirrors CREATE authority into `canManage`
 * so ordinary members never see the create/join controls; edit/delete controls
 * live only on /admin/calendar, which is itself lodge-area gated, so a
 * committee-only member (all-none admin matrix) never renders them.
