/**
 * Stale organiser-pays group settlement reaper (#1034).
 *
 * Initiating an organiser-pays settlement commits every child booking to
 * CONFIRMED (capacity-holding) before any money is charged. If the organiser
 * abandons the payment (closed tab, declined card never retried), nothing
 * released those beds: the children sat CONFIRMED-but-unpaid until check-in,
 * blocking capacity and the waitlist (PR #801 residual).
 *
 * This cron releases them: a settlement still unpaid (PENDING or FAILED) past
 * its deadline reverts its CONFIRMED unpaid children to PAYMENT_PENDING (their
 * pre-commit, non-capacity-holding state), voids any open Stripe intent so a
 * stale tab cannot capture, notifies the organiser and joiners, records
 * booking events, and triggers waitlist processing for the freed nights.
 *
 * Deadline: `updatedAt + GROUP_SETTLEMENT_REAP_HOURS` (default 48h), clamped
 * to the organiser booking's check-in so beds free before the stay begins,
 * with a two-hour floor so an arrival-day settlement is never reaped while
 * the organiser is mid-payment. A retry resets `updatedAt` (the initiate flow
 * upserts the settlement row), restarting the clock.
 *
 * Idempotent: children are re-read and reverted under the same advisory lock
 * the settle path takes, so a payment that lands just before the reaper wins
 * (SUCCEEDED settlements are skipped inside the lock), and a rerun finds no
 * CONFIRMED children and does nothing.
 *
 * Second phase (#1094): reverted children cannot be paid by the joiner (the
 * organiserSettled flag blocks joiner payment by design), so if the organiser
 * never retries, they would linger in PAYMENT_PENDING forever. Once a FAILED
 * settlement sits unretried through a second full reap window (fresh
 * `updatedAt` from the reap itself, same deadline function), its
 * organiser-settled PAYMENT_PENDING children are cancelled, each exactly
 * once, with a joiner notification. A settlement retry flips the status back
 * to PENDING and resets `updatedAt`, so a retry between reap and expiry
 * always keeps the children alive; both are re-checked on the fresh row
 * inside the advisory lock so a retry racing the cron wins. No capacity or
 * waitlist work is needed — PAYMENT_PENDING holds no beds.
 *
 * Third phase (#1236): resume an organiser-cancel group cleanup that a crash
 * interrupted. A re-invoked cancel 409s upstream (#1160) and never re-enters
 * the cleanup, so this phase re-drives it: an ORGANISER_PAYS group still not
 * CANCELLED under a CANCELLED organiser booking (older than a short grace) is an
 * unfinished cleanup. It re-invokes the same idempotent
 * settleGroupBookingOnOrganiserCancel, whose persisted refund plan reconstructs
 * (never recomputes) the per-child refund mirror. This completes the local
 * booking/capacity/refund-mirror cleanup but does NOT heal the Xero mirror (see
 * resumeInterruptedOrganiserCancels' Xero residual note).
