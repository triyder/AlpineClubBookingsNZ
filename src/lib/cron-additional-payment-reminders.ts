/**
 * Chase an uncollected additional payment (#2350).
 *
 * A booking change that raises the price after the booking was already paid
 * records the extra on the `Payment` row and, until this job existed, waited
 * silently for the member to notice. This cron emails them twice at most: a few
 * days after the change, and once more shortly before check-in. It never
 * cancels, never expires anything, and stops entirely once the stay is over —
 * that phase belongs to the admin dashboard's unpaid-finished-stays queue.
 *
 * Idempotent by claim-then-send, the same shape as the pre-arrival cron: the
 * reminder stamp is written with a guarded `updateMany` whose WHERE still
 * requires the money to be owed and the stamp to be unset for THIS obligation,
 * so a rerun (or two runners racing) claims nothing and therefore sends nothing.
 * The claim also pins the amount and the episode the read decided on, and a lost
 * claim is re-read rather than assumed to be someone else's win — otherwise a
 * modification landing in that window would be emailed at its old amount while
 * its new, larger delta was stamped as already chased.
 *
 * Checks up front, BEFORE claiming, every reason this member cannot be reached:
 * the per-booking "No emails" switch, a walk-in placeholder address, and an
 * active bounce/complaint suppression. Letting the mailer withhold instead would
 * burn the stamp on a message nobody received, so a booking silenced (or an
 * address suppressed) during the reminder window would never be chased once the
 * switch came off or the suppression was cleared. Skipping leaves the stamp
 * unset and the reminder due, and costs one cheap read per candidate — the same
 * shape as the pre-check `cron-email-retry` already does.
 *
 * ONE RULE ABOUT STAMPS, shared with the manual re-send
 * (src/lib/additional-payment-resend-service.ts): a stamp is only ever spent on
 * a message that actually went out, or one that something else will replay. Any
 * other non-`sent` outcome hands the stamps straight back.

    NOTHING IS CLAIMED ON AN INSTALLATION THAT CANNOT SEND (#3035 review), and
    this is about the DETECTOR rather than about the mail.

    The stamp-restoring path below is correct, and it is also why this early
    return is needed. Without it a copy re-claims every eligible booking on every
    run, has each message suppressed, restores each stamp, and starts again three
    hours later — writing N NEW counted `SKIPPED_NON_PRODUCTION` rows per pass,
    with `mostRecentAt` always minutes old. That is exactly the signature owner
    decision 1 asks the withheld-email count to MEAN: "a live club is being held
    back, steadily and right now". An ordinary idle staging box would produce it
    forever, and a detector that fires on every legitimate copy is a detector
    nobody reads.

    The pre-existing justification for restoring a stamp is that the checks above
    the claim have already skipped an unreachable recipient, so reaching the
    restore at all means the state changed under this very pass. That is not true
    of an environment withhold: it is a standing fact about the installation, not
    a race. So it is answered where standing facts belong — before any work.

    The email retry cron got the same early return for the same reason. Note the
    asymmetry with the withhold-handling below, which stays: this check reads the
    policy ONCE per run, and an administrator can switch the safer override on
    mid-pass, so the per-message handling is still the thing that catches it.

    WHICH PER-MESSAGE HANDLING, NAMED, because leaving it implicit let the same
    sentence be read as a claim about the retry cron, where it was not true
    (#3071 review, hoppers99). THIS job sends through `sendEmail`, which asks the
    delivery boundary for every individual message, so the early return above is
    only an optimisation and the guarantee comes from `sendEmail`. The RETRY cron
    does not go through `sendEmail` at all — it re-transmits a stored body on its
    own transport — so it has to re-ask inside its own loop, and now does.

 *  - the cooldown, on BOTH stamps, so an admin's manual re-send landing in the
 *    read→claim window cannot be followed by this email minutes later. The read
 *    already refuses inside the cooldown; this is the same test where it counts.

 * ACCEPTED RESIDUAL: claim-then-send means a crash (or a pod eviction) between

 * exists yet, so the email retry cron has nothing to replay, and for the final
 * branch BOTH stamps are already spent. The alternative, send-then-stamp, trades
