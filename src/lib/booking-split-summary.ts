  // This is the pay-step half of the single deferred "guest portion" figure
  // (#2003): booking-create prices the NON-MEMBER SUBSET on its own (no promo)
  // and stores that total as the child's `finalPriceCents`. The pre-booking
  // review banner shows the SAME figure because the booking quote prices the
  // same subset through the same helper (`priceDeferredNonMemberPortion`,
  // src/lib/policies/booking-route-decisions.ts) — the shared subset-pricing
  // path, NOT a whole-party non-member sum. That matters under a group discount,
  // where the subset can be priced differently than the whole party (the subset
  // may fall under minGroupSize while the full party meets it), so a whole-party
  // sum would under-quote this deferred charge.

/**
 * Describe the provisional non-member child of a split parent booking (#738),
 * for member-facing email copy only.
 *
 * A split (member + non-member party, outside the hold window) creates a
 * PAYMENT_PENDING parent (member places, charged up front) plus a PENDING child
 * that holds the non-member places provisionally (`parentBookingId` = parent,
 * `nonMemberHoldUntil` set, same member). This returns that child's guest count
 * and hold deadline so the parent's confirmation email can explain the split.
 *
 * Returns null when the booking is not a split parent (no such child), or when
 * the lookup fails — the caller then sends the ordinary confirmation with no
 * provisional section. This is a read-only describe helper: it never mutates
 * booking state and must not change any hold/settlement decision.
