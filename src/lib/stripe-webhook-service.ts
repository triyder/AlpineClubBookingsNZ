 * decisions 10 Aug 2026). After the refund has returned this handler records it as
 * an already-DISMISSED `ManualRefundTask` so the finance card is a complete record
 * of automatic refunds, for a deleted AND a merely cancelled booking; and it sends
 * its own accurate, unmuteable alert instead of the generic payment-failure mail.

 * rather than copied into it.
 *
 * ONE THING THAT CAN NOW STOP THE REFUND, AND IT IS NOT A GATE (#2774 D2 — the
 * orchestrator's call on that issue's Recommended option; the owner has not ruled,
 * and it is reversible. `INV-ADDPAY-039`'s authority line has the full statement).
 * If a `ManualRefundTask` for this capture is already
 * `COMPLETED`, an operator has paid the member back by hand and the ledger holds
 * their allocation — so Stripe's refund on top of it pays the member TWICE. The
 * refund is withheld, a `critical` audit row is written and the club is told the
 * money did NOT go out, so a person reconciles it. This is not the gating
 * `INV-ADDPAY-037` rules out: that would withhold a refund the member is owed,

  // would write a SECOND refund allocation through `resolveManualRefundTask` and
  // double-count one refund in the ledger.
  //
  // #2760 — and when nothing raised one, the row is WRITTEN here, already
  // DISMISSED. Three of the four orderings never reach the confirm route's raise
  // (webhook first, a member who closes the tab after paying, and the interleaved
  // ordering the raise's refund fence declines), and the raise never fires at all
  // for a booking that is cancelled but not deleted — so the automatic refund
  // used to leave no operator record on any of them. Never OPEN, no allocation,
  // no operator queued: the refund is already done and this is the bookkeeping
  // row for it.
  //
  // Matched on this exact payment intent, so the cash/manual cancellation task
  // `booking-cancel.ts` can raise on the same booking is never touched. Fenced on
  // OPEN for the close and idempotent on the intent for the write, so a webhook
  // replay neither re-dates nor duplicates. Never allowed to fail the webhook:
  // the money is already back with the member and a 500 here would replay the
  // whole refund path for a bookkeeping row.

  // trip happens inside it.

  // already-DISMISSED row written, and a `critical`
  // `booking.payment.auto_refund_record_failed` audit entry if that write is lost
  // — is one shared implementation, called from here and from the sibling
  // primary-payment handler. It is deliberately NOT a copy in each: two
  // implementations of this rule drifting apart at the next change is the defect
  // class this repository keeps re-finding. Every "why" is on
  // `recordAutomaticLateCaptureRefund`.
  //
  // AWAITED, unlike the alert below. An un-awaited database write can be killed
  // when the handler's response is returned, and this row is the only operator
  // surface the refund appears on. It can never fail the webhook: the money is
  // already back with the member and a 500 would replay the whole refund path for
  // a bookkeeping row, so its failure is audited rather than thrown.

/**
 * Late Stripe capture of a booking's OWN (PRIMARY) payment on a booking that is
 * already CANCELLED (#1350). The sibling of
 * `handleCancelledBookingAdditionalPaymentSucceeded` above: record the capture
 * truthfully, refund it in full under an idempotent per-intent key, alert the
 * admins, and skip Xero invoice creation.
 *
 * WHAT #2773 CHANGED HERE (the orchestrator's call on that issue's Recommended
 * option; the owner has not ruled — `INV-ADDPAY-039`'s authority line), and why it
 * needed a decision at all. #2760/#2761 fixed the booking-CHANGE handler only, and scoped
 * `INV-ADDPAY-037` / `INV-ADDPAY-038` to it rather than letting them overclaim. So
 * this handler kept refunding with the same `cancelled_booking_late_capture`
 * reason and writing the same `booking.payment.refunded_after_cancellation` audit
 * entry, while leaving **no record an operator could find** and sending the generic
 * **muteable** "Payment Failed" mail — a subject describing nothing that happened
 * (a payment was captured late and handed straight back), on a preference any admin
 * could switch off. It now routes through the same shared machinery as its sibling:
 * the already-DISMISSED `ManualRefundTask` the finance card lists, and the
 * unmuteable alert that names the money movement. The two invariants lose their
 * scoping clause in the same change.
 *
 * NOT A NEW READ. `deletedAt` comes from the booking row the dispatch above already
 * loaded (`findUnique` with `include`), so the population that selects the row's
 * `reason` sentence and the alert's follow-up costs nothing here; it is re-read once
 * AFTER the Stripe round trip, inside the shared recorder, for the reason stated
 * there.
 *
 * #2774's FENCE APPLIES HERE TOO, and one thing about it is worth stating plainly
 * rather than left for a reader to assume: nothing in the tree currently raises an
 * `OPEN` `ManualRefundTask` for a PRIMARY payment intent — the confirm-modification
 * -payment route is the only raiser of one of these and it handles modification
 * intents — so today the fence cannot fire on this path. It is here anyway because
 * the fence is keyed on the payment intent rather than on the handler, so a reader
 * of one handler must not conclude the other is unfenced, and a future raiser is
 * covered by construction. `booking-cancel.ts`'s cash-settlement task sits on the
 * same booking and payment but carries a different `reason`, so it is correctly
 * never matched: it settles a different sum.
 *
 * A refund failure is deliberately NOT swallowed, as in the sibling handler: the
 * webhook returns 500, the processed-event marker is cleared, and Stripe's retry
 * replays the same idempotent refund keys.
