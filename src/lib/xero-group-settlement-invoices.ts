/**
 * Combined group-settlement invoice against Xero.
 *
 * When an ORGANISER_PAYS organiser settles by Internet Banking, the whole group
 * is billed as one combined Xero invoice raised to the organiser's contact, with
 * line items aggregated across every joiner child booking. The invoice is emailed
 * so the organiser can pay it by bank transfer; inbound Xero reconciliation then
 * flips all the joiner children to PAID (see
 * `applyGroupSettlementSucceededFromInvoice` in group-settlement.ts).
 *
 * Mirrors `createXeroInvoiceForBooking`, minus the Stripe payment recording: an
 * Internet Banking invoice is never paid from a Stripe charge, so there is no
 * Xero payment to record here — it is always emailed and reconciled on payment.
