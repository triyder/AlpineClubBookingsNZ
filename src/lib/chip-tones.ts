/**
 * Single source of truth for chip / pill colour classes (#156).
 *
 * The admin tables render many small status and label chips: the shared
 * `StatusChip`, the payments/bookings `MiniChip`, and the members `InfoChip`.
 * Each of those previously carried its OWN private copy of the same tone -> class
 * map, so they could silently drift. This module holds the one map they all use.
 *
 * There are two families of tone, both backed by CSS tokens in `globals.css`:
 *
 *  - SEMANTIC tones (`neutral | info | success | warning | danger`) carry MEANING
 *    and back `StatusChip`. Every pair dark-adapts and clears WCAG AA (verified
 *    in `src/lib/__tests__/status-chip.test.tsx`).
 *  - CATEGORICAL scales (`cat1..cat6`) exist only to keep sibling values within
 *    one column visually DISTINCT (e.g. the settlement kinds, the payment states,
 *    the booking statuses). They are the generated substrate scales, so they
 *    follow the club theme and stay AA by construction.
 *
 * Meaning is always carried by icon + label, never colour alone.

 *  the ONLY categorical chip vocabulary: sibling column values that carry no
 *  severity (booking/payment sub-states, audit categories, member badges) reach a

 *  inside `app-theme-scope` that is no longer true, because #2145 replaced the
 *  inert `--muted-foreground` (an alias of `--foreground`) with a derived tone
 *  that is CLAMPED to clear AA on `--muted` in both modes. The pairing stays on
 *  `--foreground` for a different and still-valid reason: a status chip carries
 *  MEANING, so it reads at full text weight like its four coloured siblings —
 *  each of which uses its own accent, not a de-emphasised one. It also keeps the
 *  chip readable in the default (non-club-themed) shadcn scope, where
 *  `--muted-foreground` is a mid-grey this project does not gate. */

//  G2b (`bg step-3 / text step-11` clears WCAG AA for every scale, both modes), so
//  the chips follow the club theme and stay AA by construction. `neutral` keeps
//  the shadcn role tokens (neutrals are not exposed as numbered steps). #2218 P4
//  added cat6 and RETIRED the legacy `--hue-*` accent pairs entirely — every
//  former hue consumer now reaches a cat scale.
